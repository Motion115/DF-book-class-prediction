Literature & Fiction,"Description: Being a princess is not all glittery parties and lavish holidays by the sea. Well, actually, it is, but it's not all fun. Young Princess Victoria is constantly surrounded by family and advisors, allowing her no privacy and very few opportunities to express herself until she purloins an old ledger book from one of Kensington Palace's stables. She promptly begins recording her secrets, daily trials, and naughty witticisms (her uncle, King George IV, has big, plump hands, ""the size of a plucked quail."") in this very incongruous journal. The biggest secret of all, however, is one that is kept from our heroine. It is not until well into her two-year-long diary that Victoria pieces together her family tree to discover that she is next in line to the throne. This intriguing installment of the Royal Diaries series will inspire many readers to delve deeper into Queen Victoria's life as the longest reigning queen of England. Author Anna Kirwan's fictionalized account is entertaining and enlightening, packed with facts about royal customs in the early 19th century. Historical notes, a family tree, and photos provide more factual information for the curious reader. (Ages 9 to 12) --Emilie CoulterGr 4-7-A charming portrayal of three years in the childhood of Queen Victoria. The nine-year-old begins by confessing that she stole a livestock ledger from the stable in order to have a journal in which to write her private thoughts. She fills the pages with details of life in Kensington Palace, from the menu at breakfast, her daily lessons and tutoring sessions to a ball given by her uncle the King, a vacation by the sea, and the negative influence of Captain Conroy, one of her mother's advisers. Throughout, the princess exhibits a shrewd awareness of palace life and a growing sense of the larger role she is being prepared for and must shortly assume. An epilogue reveals that Victoria became Queen just after her 18th birthday. While at first the young princess's voice appears a bit mature, as readers learn more about her demanding education and extraordinary upbringing, she becomes more plausible. A historical note, photographs, a family tree, and a glossary of characters round out the novel. Fans of the series will be delighted.Kristen Oravec, Cuyahoga County Public Library, Strongsville, OHCopyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.; Title: The Royal Diaries: Victoria, May Blossom of Britannia, England 1829",0,17160,"[16961, 16980, 16989, 17033, 17034, 17042, 17043, 17055, 17109, 17112, 17125, 17134, 17136, 17156, 17161, 17170, 17176, 17196, 17197, 17383, 17442, 17927, 22112, 22143, 22162, 22167, 22223, 24174, 24476, 24517, 48225]"
Animals,"Description: PreSchool-K&mdash;Cat the Cat visits her friends, asking them to make their sounds. The dog woofs, the chick peeps, the cow moos, but the bunny is silent. As Bunny the Bunny makes no response, the others look at him with sympathy and say in unison, ""sounds like&hellip;somebody needs a hug!"" On the one hand, the message seems to be that even if you are different, your friends still love you. On the other hand, an underlying message is that if you are different, your friends will feel sorry for you. Not quite the same as celebrating the differences. The illustrations are characteristically spare with flat, unshaded colors outlined in black. Repeated use of a pale green background on each spread ties the whole book together nicely. Using few words, Willems relies on facial expressions and body posturing to convey humor with minimal detail. Making the animal sounds concept more interesting is a secondary story line: the animals are all preparing for a tea party. Cat the Cat gaily carries a basket covered with a checked napkin as she visits each animal who in turn is preparing something to share at the party. Willems does almost everything right. Children will enjoy making animal sounds and will laugh at his silly humor. But the underlying message that differences may elicit pity is an unfortunate flaw that keeps this book from being a winner.&mdash;Mary Hazelton, Elementary Schools in Warren &amp; Waldoboro, ME (c) Copyright 2010.

Sure, he learned a lot about electromagnets, but he learned even more about the pitfalls of being a know-it-all. It all started when his principal announced the school's first-ever science fair. The plot thickened when a local businessman announced that a computer would be the grand prize. A self-described computer nut, Jake refused to work with his best friend because he didn't want to share the prize. Finally, it came to him that his single-mindedness was turning him into a person he didn't like, and his project wasn't fun. Even though he and his partner took second prize, and thus no computer, Jake valued the experience. He sounds like a regular fourth grader as he describes his teachers and classmates. But he also digs deep to reveal the character-building lessons in everyday events. Full-page, black-and-white drawings show the competitive classmates as they work toward winning the great prize.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: Kindergarten-Grade 2Based on the librarian from the author's childhood, the story follows one woman's dedication to bringing reading material to people in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. Starting with hauling books up from her basement to later driving around in the town's green bookmobile, Miss Dorothy eventually inspires the town to purchase a building for a library of their very own. Beautiful, soft landscapes of the rugged terrain throughout the seasons serve as a backdrop for this charming story of a librarian on the go. While Miss Dorothy's dreams of a stately brick building as a true library seems to undermine the worth of the bookmobile a bit, the overall effect is that of nostalgia and a sweet homage to a special woman. Most adult readers have a memory of a Miss Dorothy in their lives, be it a teacher, neighbor, or librarian, and most children will enjoy this look back in time. A lovely addition to any collection.Sarah Townsend, Norfolk Public Library, VA (c) Copyright 2011. Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc. No redistribution permitted.As a youngster, Dorothy Thomas knew she would become a librarian and planned to be in charge of a fine brick library like the one in her small Massachusetts town. However, after getting her library degree, she married and moved to rural North Carolina, where she operated a bookmobile for many years, until a library was established. As the years passed, her library-on-wheels blossomed, and Dorothy profoundly affected many lives through her love of books. Finely drawn, colorful illustrations feature a good number of landscapes, giving a strong sense of the Blue Ridge mountain setting while closely matching the story line of the brief text as Dorothy and her green van visit patrons in small towns, farms, schools, and even snowbound homes. The final page features an authors note that establishes that Dorothy Thomas was a real person and reaffirms her influence in her rural community.

Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Description: ""Treachery, mystery, humor, and magic abound in this intriguing, well-crafted fantasy."" -- -- School Library JournalDiana Wynne Jones was raised in the village of Thaxted, in Essex, England. She has been a compulsive storyteller for as long as she can remember enjoying most ardently those tales dealing with witches, hobgoblins, and the like. Ms. Jones lives in Bristol, England, with her husband, a professor of English at Bristol University. They have three sons and two granddaughters. In Her Own Words...""I decided to be a writer at the age of eight, but I did not receive any encouragement in this ambition until thirty years later. I think this ambition was fired-or perhaps exacerbated is a better word-by early marginal contacts with the Great, when we were evacuated to the English Lakes during the war. The house we were in had belonged to Ruskin's secretary and had also been the home of the children in the books of Arthur Ransome. One day, finding I had no paper to draw on, I stole from the attic a stack of exquisite flower-drawings, almost certainly by Ruskin himself, and proceeded to rub them out. I was punished for this. Soon after, we children offended Arthur Ransome by making a noise on the shore beside his houseboat. He complained. So likewise did Beatrix Potter, who lived nearby. It struck me then that the Great were remarkably touchy and unpleasant (even if, in Ruskin's case, it was posthumous), and I thought I would like to be the same, without the unpleasantness.""I started writing children's books when we moved to a village in Essex where there were almost no books. The main activities there were hand-weaving, hand-making pottery, and singing madrigals, for none of which I had either taste or talent. So, in intervals between trying to haunt the church and sitting on roofs hoping to learn to fly, I wrote enormous epic adventure stories which I read to my sisters instead of the real books we did not have. This writing was stopped, though, when it was decided I must be coached to go to University. A local philosopher was engaged to teach me Greek and philosophy in exchange for a dollhouse (my family never did things normally), and I eventually got a place at Oxford.""At this stage, despite attending lectures by J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, I did not expect to be writing fantasy. But that was what I started to write when I was married and had children of my own. It was what they liked best. But small children do not allow you the use of your brain. They used to jump on my feet to stop me thinking. And I had not realized how much I needed to teach myself about writing. I took years to learn, and it was not until my youngest child began school that I was able to produce a book which a publisher did not send straight back.""As soon as my books began to be published, they started coming true. Fantastic things that I thought I had made up keep happening to me. The most spectacular was Drowned Ammet. The first time I went on a boat after writing that book, an island grew up out of the sea and stranded us. This sort of thing, combined with the fact that I have a travel jinx, means that my life is never dull.""Diana Wynne Jones is the author of many highly praised books for young readers, as well as three plays for children and a novel for adults.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: With great affection and an appealing nostalgia, Hurst (Through the Lock, reviewed below) recounts the story of her father, an avid rock collector from the time he was a boy. When people commented that ""he had rocks in his pockets and rocks in his head,"" he would answer with an agreeable ""Maybe I have,"" then reach into his pocket and eagerly add, ""Take a look at this one."" This response, conveying both the hero's humility and passion, becomes a recurring refrain. Stevenson conveys the fellow's easygoing manner with elegant pen-and-ink wash illustrations. Together, author and artist chart the boy's growth into manhood and touch on the world events that shape him. As a young man, he opens a filling station, where he displays his labeled rocks and minerals and learns how to repair the then-new Model T. After the Depression shuts down his business, he moves his cherished collection into the attic of his home, finding odd jobs wherever he can. The story's conclusion will prove as satisfying to readers as it was to Hurst's father: the director of the local museum offers him a dream job the position of curator of mineralogy. Dominated by earth tones, Stevenson's artwork convincingly evokes both the personality of this endearing protagonist and the period in which he lived. An emphatic endorsement for youngsters to follow their passions. Ages 5-up.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.PreSchool-Grade 3-Hurst tells the story of her father's passion for rock collecting in this gently humorous picture book. ""People said he had rocks in his pockets and rocks in his head. He didn't mind. It was usually true."" As a boy, he collected rocks. When he grew up, his carefully labeled rock collection occupied a place of honor on the back wall of his filling station. However, once the Depression hit and the filling station closed, he had to look for work. When there was none to be found, he would go to the science museum, where he eventually attracted the attention of the director. A stint as the nighttime janitor, combined with his unquenchable love for rocks, eventually led to his being named Curator of Mineralogy, despite his lack of a college degree. The narrative has the polish of a family story often told, and the author paints a touching picture of a man who quietly pursues his passion, no matter what others think. Stevenson's watercolor-and-ink illustrations, with their trademark sketchy style, capture the mild-mannered hero perfectly.

In an unnamed city, the bumbling Mayor Moe and his councillors, a multicolored group of anthropomorphized creatures, make unfair laws, each of which brings unforeseen consequences. Topics range from freedom of assembly to employment discrimination. The sole voice of reason is Councillor Bug, who consistently squeaks, ""That's not fair!"" At the end of each section, there is a summary and questions to get readers thinking. While this selection is very Western-centric, there is no mention of the Bill of Rights, which to an audience in the United States may be confusing and limit understanding of how these legal rights are guaranteed.

"Science, Nature & How It Works","Description: Scott takes the 2006 downgrading of Pluto from planet to dwarf planet as a teachable moment for discussing questions such as how the number of planets has changed through the centuries, what can be called a planet, and how scientists come to conclusionsand occasionally change their minds. Following a section on early astronomy, a succinct, timely, and somewhat surprising account of planetary history begins with Herschel's 1781 discovery of the seventh planet, Uranus. Twenty years later, Piazzi found Ceres, which was considered the eighth planet. In 1846, Galle discovered Neptune, bringing the total to nine. When objects similar to Ceres were found in the same orbit, all (including Ceres) were placed in a new category: asteroids. In other words, even before the discovery of Pluto, there were once nine planets, but one of them was demoted. Beautifully designed, the book includes many well-captioned, color illustrations, from period portraits to NASA images to artist's conceptions.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: PreS-Gr 2Here is a book that parents and grandparents, older brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, and caregivers will read repeatedly to the babies they love. It's a simple and comprehensive list of the daily activities of an almost-walking baby and his loving family. As it happens, he lives in an urban environment and spends the day with his daddy while his sister's at school and his mother is gonepresumably to work. In a three-page sequence that will endear the book to librarians, the little guy goes to a storytime at the library (and is taken out when he's ""starting to fuss""). A shopping trip, a playground visit, meals, an under-table tea party with Sister, bathtime, a story, a song, and bedtime round out Baby's day, all interspersed with plenty of cuddling. Yoo depicts folks pursuing their individual interests in ways that any baby would enjoy examining: another infant is riding behind his father on a bicycle, and there are dogs, trucks and changing weather to notice. The linoleum block prints are warm and homey. The palette is mostly drawn from autumn leaves, until moonlight shines into the blue bedroom where the baby succumbs to sleep. This is the sort of book you finish with a sigh of contentment.Miriam Lang Budin, Chappaqua Library, NYPolly Kanevsky is the author of the picture book Sleepy Boy, illustrated by Stephanie Anderson and recipient of three starred reviews, including one from Kirkus Reviews calling it unusual and captivating.

"Science, Nature & How It Works","Description: These books discuss the purpose of each featured part, its diversity among various types of plants, and its function as food for humans. Each spread has a clear color photo that covers a strip of the left-hand page as well as the entire right side. The illustrations are particularly interesting because of their varying perspectives, some taken at ground level, other reaching upward to the soaring heights of treetops. The texts consist of two easy sentences per spread. Some of the explanations are unnecessarily simplified, and the science suffers a bit. In Stems, for example, the text misleadingly says Leaves make food out of sunlight, without mentioning water and minerals. As indicated in a note to parents and teachers, these books are designed to provide reading practice as well as subject knowledge and specific vocabulary. --School Library Journal; Vol. 53, No. 1; Page 112, January 2007The Plant Parts series consists of six books titled Roots, Seeds, Flowers, Fruits, Stems, and Leaves. The books are aimed at the very earliest readers, from prekindergarten through grade 2. The sentences are very short with a limited vocabulary, in the face of which the factual presentaiton is nonetheless very nicely done. Each page of text is paired with a full-page photo. The photos are beautiful and aptly illustrate the text. Most of the photos use subjects that would be quickly recognized by the reader; for example, Fruits has excellent photos of apples, kiwis, and peaches, while Roots has equally excellent photos of radishes, carrots, and turnips. The photos add to the appeal of the book and probably help early readers recognize words. Each books has a glossary, an index, and a list of further readings. In addition, reference is made to a child-friendly search engine that would be useful to children at the upper edge of the target audience. Used as a set, these books give a good, age-appropriate introduction to plants and would be useful in a classroom setting or in early childhood-oriented garden programs. They are not hands-on science books, but it is easy to imagine activities that would nicely complement their text. --Science Books &amp; Films; Vol. 43, No. 2; Pages 82-83, March 2007This new series is an excellent introduction to the parts of a plant. Focusing on just one plant part in each book, the opening chapters present clear and simple explanations of why plants need that particular part to grow and flourish. Succeeding chapters discuss the varieties of that plant part found in nature. The full-page photographs beautifully illustrate the books subjects. Whereas most of the definitions in the glossaries are appropriately worded for young children, some younger readers may need additional help. Also included are instructions for finding relevant Internet sites through FactHound, a very attractive, fun, and easy-to-use Web site that suggests pre-selected, age-appropriate Internet resources. In addition to very effectively supporting science standards related to the identification of plant parts, the books features can also be used to teach about the parts of a book. Young readers will certainly enjoy using these attractive, accurate, and carefully designed books. Bibliography. Glossary. Index.

Literature & Fiction,"Description: Grade 4-6. A new entry in a series of Christian fiction that places a young protagonist in the path of a heroic person who has made the world a better place. The horrors of war and disregard for the common soldier underlie this story of two brothers who leave home out of financial necessity to join the British forces fighting the war in Crimea. The older brother dies in the hopeless charge of the Light Brigade. Robby, the younger sibling, has his hand amputated by an unconcerned doctor in a filthy field hospital. The boy is placed in service to Florence Nightingale and becomes devoted to her, admiring her determination, courage, and self-sacrifice. The descriptions of war and its results are vivid. The main characters are engaging, and the historical background is accurate and informative. Villains abound, and they're not on the Russian side in this war. Readers of Patricia Beatty or G. Clifton Wisler's historical novels will be drawn to this title.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: Gr 47Two stories of loss collide in this work of realistic fiction. Zavion and his father lose their house and everything they own in Hurricane Katrina. Zavion's already experienced the death of his mother, and he has created a personal code of conduct to help him survive. After he and his father take food from an abandoned convenience store in New Orleans, Zavion believes he has a debt to pay. That's going to be hard to do from Baton Rouge, where he and his father have relocated. Meanwhile, in Vermont, Henry is dealing with sudden death of his friend Wayne. Henry was with Wayne at the time, but the memories of the event are too painful for him to recall. The two boys passed a special marble back and forth for good luck for years. When Henry's mother donates some of his clothes to victims of Hurricane Katrina, she accidentally gives away the marble, which becomes the catalyst for merging the two plots, with Henry making his way to New Orleans in hopes of finding it and Zavion hatching his own plan to travel to the city to pay his debt. Smith excels at capturing the urgency of crisis, and strong, fast-paced openings of both plotlines pull readers right into the story. While the narrative is based on coincidence and chance, the voices and losses of Zavion and Henry are plausible and heartbreaking. Less believable are the many minor characters in the book, who are difficult to keep track of and who are sometimes inserted without context. However, the disorientation this creates is not entirely out of place here, since the novel mirrors the characters' feelings and experiences. The author is at her best when she conveys emotionally charged moments, with the prose reminiscent of a free verse poem; a particularly memorable moment involves the two main characters literally running into each other. It is refreshing to see the feelings of two middle grade boys explored so fearlessly.

"Science, Nature & How It Works","Description: Detailed yet accessible text begins with ""electrons on the move"" and explains how electricity is generated at a power plant and travels across wires to brightly lit homes. Suen also covers how interior wiring, breakers, switches, and outlets work. Illustrated with multimedia artwork with a 3-D effect, the book concludes with electricity safety tips.-Book Links November 1, 2014Raising the awareness of any reader who's ever switched on a light or wondered what those wires above the street are, Suen traces the long ""dance"" of electrons from a (water-driven) generator to a home's plugs, lamps and computer screens. Linked by lines of poem -- ""Humming, thrumming, / power's coming / in the wires / from big to small / to power it all"" -- her commentary offers simple but specific descriptions of how, for instance, step-up and step-down transformers work, what ground wires and circuit breakers do and even what's behind those ubiquitous switch plates. With help from occasional discreet labels, Carrick's realistic, low-relief collages follow wires over transmission towers and wooden poles, down through electric meters and cutaway walls. Suen closes with a list of safety tips and, for children curious about topics she doesn't cover, such as difference between volts and amps, or AC and DC, a handful of print and online resources. Audiences who find Joanna Cole's Magic School Bus and the Electric Field Trip, illus by Bruce Degen (1997), too busy to absorb may come away from this more linear approach with a clearer idea of what powers their everyday infrastructure.-Kirkus Reviews - June 15, 2007 This introduction to electricity traces the path of electrons from the power station to electronic devices used in the home. A series of spreads with a few paragraphs of text describes each stage along the way. This progression works well, covering the physical implements and machines as well as general scientific concepts. The important role of transformers, for example, emerges in a logical way, reinforcing the key concept that electricity is an energy that can be controlled and guided. Acrylic mixed-media illustrations are informative, with clear labels to identify specific components. The uncrowded layout and three-dimensional look are especially effective. Each spread leads neatly into the next one, so the visual flow is uninterrupted. Readers see wires reaching the electric meter, then a page turn shows that meter close up, while the subsequent spread reveals the inside wires moving out from the meter. A few descriptions are oversimplified, but a glossary fills in needed details. Joanna Cole's The Magic School Bus and the Electric Field Trip (Scholastic, 1997) and Barbara Seuling's Flick a Switch (Holiday House, 2003) cover more ground, and Molly Bang's My Light (Scholastic, 2004) is more visually dazzling, but this title succeeds with its carefully focused approach. By sticking consistently to the topic of how electricity reaches the home without trying to cover history, trivia, or more complex science, the fundamental information comes through in an appealing way that kids can fully understand.-School Library Journal - July 1, 2007 In this picture book for elementary students, Suen covers the basics of how electricity moves from power plant to cozy, lamp-lit home. The text works on two levels. Each spread features short paragraphs that present definitions in clear language: ""Electricity is electrons on the move."" A few words, in larger print, appear on each page, and when read aloud create a bouncing rhyme that seems aimed at children younger than the audience for the science and the pictures. The mixed-media art illustrates the concepts with mixed success. Some spreads, such as one explaining how power is ""stepped down"" at a transformer, need more detail to help kids full envision what the words describe. Most successful are the scenes of long lines reaching across landscapes, demonstrating that power is generated far away and travels great distances before it is used. There aren't many titles that explain electricity for this age group; recommend this one with some of the other books in the appended reading list. A glossary and power safety tips conclude.Booklist - August 1, 2007Anastasia Suen is the author of dozens of books for young readers, including SUBWAY (Viking) and RED LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT (Harcourt).

Geography & Cultures,"Description: K-Gr 3-Otis is back, this time anticipating Christmas and the birth of a new foal. To add to his excitement, he receives a new horn, his first Christmas present ever. His joy is short-lived, however, when, in the middle of a snowy night, he overhears that the mare is sick: ""We need Doc Baker out here tonight or we'll lose 'em both!"" When the farmhand sent to get Doc plunges into a snowdrift during the raging storm, Otis, as always, comes to the rescue, setting out ""with snow up to his chin."" He gets lost in the woods only to discover that he is perched on the precipice of a hill. Bravely heading down a steep, slippery branch, he reaches the doctor's house, alerts him with his horn, and brings him back to save the day. The grayish-blue hues that predominate in Long's lovely, large-framed illustrations create a sense of cold stillness. Executed in gouache and pencil, they depict the red tractor in sharp contrast to countryside and woods blanketed in deep snow. There are few surprises here, and the tree branch jutting from the hill seems forced. Traveling down the branch leads Otis a bit too conveniently almost to Doc Baker's door. Otis's fans may turn to this one, but it is an additional purchase.-Marianne Saccardi, formerly at Norwalk Community College, CT(c) Copyright 2013. Library Journal. LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc. No redistribution permitted.*Starred Review* Otis the tractor returns in a Christmas story of courage and friendship set during a terrible snowstorm at the farm. When the mares labor becomes difficult on Christmas Eve, a vet is neededbut the truck is stuck in a snowdrift. Otis makes a brave decision: hell get Doc. Plowing through the woods on a rescue mission, he finds himself on a difficult path. Longs text conveys not just the danger, treacherous, slippery, but also Otis effort, putt puff puttedy chuff. But how will he wake Doc in the middle of the night? The farmers Christmas gift, a shiny new horn, will do the trick. The illustrations wonderfully enhance the story, from the joy of the animals prancing around the Christmas tree to Otis expressive response to the events around him: pride in his gift, concern for his friend, determination to arrive at his destination. Highlighting the always changing perspective, aerial scenes give readers a sense of the big, snowy picture, and close-ups show the farmers concern. Longs palette reflects the coldness and heaviness of the snow, and then lightness as the farmer prays for a miracle. The view into the barn door, once all is well, is reminiscent of another barn birth, and the text reads, Well, would you look at that! That sums things up nicely.

Biographies,"Description: Douglas Yacka is the author of Eat, Drink, and Be Mad Libs and co-author of Give My Regards to Mad Libs.Who Was Andrew Jackson? It was still dark on the morning of January 8, 1815. In an army camp just outside of New Orleans, Louisiana, General Andrew Jackson sat alone in his tent. He had a very important decision to make. Andrew either had to surrender his American soldiers to the British army or lead his troops into battle. Andrew left his tent and walked through the camp. He looked at the faces of the men who had fought beside him over the last few weeks. They were cold and hungry and tired. They had been fighting the British for weeks, even through Christmas and New Years Day. To make matters worse, he and his men knew that the British army was twice the size of theirs. In every direction, the bright red coats of the British soldiers surrounded them in the woods. But Andrew had a plan. Even though his troops were outnumbered, they knew these woods better than the British. He knew that the British army wasnt expecting an early-morning attack. And he knew that he wasnt going to return from the war as a failure. Andrew woke his soldiers and told them to prepare for battle. As soon as it was light enough to see, General Jackson sent troops out in all directions, attacking the British from every side. The British army was taken completely by surprise. They were not prepared for this type of battle. Many British officers and their general were killed quickly, leaving the soldiers without leaders to give them orders. Andrew and his men won a major victory in just thirty minutes! The epic fight is called the Battle of New Orleans. Jackson became a national hero, and he was eventually elected the seventh president of the United States. Throughout his life, Andrew would face difficulty and danger with bravery, just as he did on that morning in 1815. His actions helped to shape a young nation as it continued to grow. A self-taught man, he gave many Americans hope that theyd shape a better future for themselves. For this reason, Andrew Jackson became known as the peoples president. Today, however, Andrew Jackson also is remembered for some shameful events, including his terrible treatment of Native Americans and for his terrible attitudes such as his support for slavery. Jackson was a very complicated manstubborn, brave, quick-tempered, loyal, unforgivingand he has left a mixed legacy for the history books. Chapter 1:A Brave Boy Andrew Jackson was born in what was then known as the Carolinas on March 15, 1767. His parents were from Scotland. They had come to America in 1765 in search of a better life. Sailing across the Atlantic was a long and dangerous trip. It took around six weeks to cross the ocean in those days. Even after Andrew Sr., Elizabeth, and their two sons, Hugh and Robert, finally landed at Philadelphia, their journey was not over. They still had to travel five hundred miles by carriage to reach the home of relatives in South Carolina. The area where they lived was called the Waxhaw settlement. There wasnt much there at that time, and most of the settlers were poor. In addition, the land was already home to Native Americans who had lived there for generations. They did not welcome these new intruders. Violence often broke out between the local Cherokee tribe and the settlers. Andrews father built a small log cabin for his growing family. He was a farmer who struggled to keep food on the table, and often worked seven days a week. It was a very hard life. Andrew Jackson Sr. died in the winter of 1766, shortly before Andrew was born. Now Andrews mother had to struggle on by herself, with three boys and a farm to run. She was a very serious woman. She taught her sons about the importance of hard work. As a child, Andrew was smart and curious. He learned to read at an early age. Most adults back then didnt know how. Andrew was also full of energy. He could be wild and defiant. When he played games with his friends, he hated to lose. He often fought with other boys, even those who were bigger and stronger. Once, when he was being teased, he shouted, By God, if one of you laughs, Ill kill him! Until Andrew was nine, South Carolina was one of thirteen colonies belonging to Great Britain. But in 1776, the colonies declared their independence. War startedthe American Revolution. The Jacksons supported the fight for independence. Andrew, still a young boy at the time, was chosen to read the Declaration of Independence out loud when a copy arrived in town. It was a great honor. Andrews oldest brother, Hugh, joined the American army and was killed in battle. Andrew was very upset and angry over Hughs death. He and Robert wanted to be soldiers like Hugh. They wanted to fight the British and make them pay for the death of their brother. But Andrew was only thirteen years old. When he tried to join the army, he was told that he was too young. The army made him a messenger instead. His job was to carry information back and forth between American army camps in South Carolina without the British army finding out. Andrew liked the adventure and danger, and was glad to help fight the enemy. In addition to the British, Andrew had to avoid the Cherokee Indians, who were known as fierce fighters. The Cherokees had made peace treaties and trading deals with the British, and they were not about to lose them to the new American settlers. During one battle with the British in Waxhaw, Andrew and Robert were both captured and taken to a prison in Camden, about forty miles away. The two boys were terrified. One of the British officers ordered Andrew to clean his boots. That made Andrew furious. He wasnt going to obey the enemy. Andrew gathered up all his courage, stood up, and refused! The soldier became so angry, he swung his sword at Andrews head. The wound left a large scar that he had for the rest of his life. Andrew and Robert were thrown into prison with very little food, water, or medicine. Many prisoners caught a serious disease called smallpox, including the two boys. When the boys mother found out that her sons had been captured, she traveled the forty miles to the prison. Elizabeth convinced the British to include her sons in a prisoner exchange, and they were freed. Unfortunately, Robert was much sicker than Andrew. He died soon after arriving home. Andrews mother also became ill and died a few months later. At only fourteen years old, Andrew was left alone. Shortly before her death, Elizabeth told Andrew, In this world you will have to make your own way.; Title: Who Was Andrew Jackson?",17,16596,"[16606, 16608, 16617, 16618, 16623, 16715, 18453, 18455, 18474, 18499, 18523, 18578, 18588, 18607, 18609, 18614, 18631, 18696, 18703, 18734, 18768, 18819, 18833, 18847, 18919, 18939, 18978, 19026, 19029, 19071, 19082, 19088, 19096, 19101, 19125, 19127, 19132, 19136, 19139, 19141, 19149, 19156, 19160, 19166, 19173, 19185, 19209, 19223, 19231, 19247, 19248, 19256, 19258, 19268, 19279, 19282, 19283, 19286, 19288, 19291, 19310, 19318, 19331, 19339, 19354, 19355, 19370, 19424, 19436, 19440, 19650, 19654, 19673, 19677, 19678, 19679, 19680, 19683, 20299, 20304, 20308, 20312, 20320, 20351, 45490, 45504, 58269]"

"Science, Nature & How It Works","Description: Gr 5-8-This series operates on the premise that the way to get children interested in science is to pepper the text with feeble bathroom jokes and other lame attempts at humor. None of the titles is immune. It is difficult to determine what ""Get your mind out of the toilet.

While some of the cartoon illustrations, photos, and diagrams do help clarify the texts, others are totally pointless.

Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Description: Gr 46Dwarves live and work underground, and dwarflings are taught to fear the Surface and the humans who live there. Borlen's scandalous curiosity about the Earth and his fear of depths make life underground a misery, earning him the nickname Grump. When he eventually escapes to the Surface, he befriends a human queen who treats him as a trusted advisor. It is only when the queen uses Borlen's words to justify her attempt to kill Snow White that he realizes her true character. When he finds himself magically sworn to serve the queen and to protect Snow White, he struggles to do the right thing while finding a place where he belongs. Shurtliff's fourth fractured fairy tale boasts the same intricate world-building, expansive character development, and rich imagery as her other novels. By shining the spotlight on a seemingly secondary character, Shurtliff explores the theme of how we assign value to people: being different can make you either an outcast or someone special. The story moves at a fast pace and deftly balances lighthearted humor with emotional weight. Many readers will recognize the feelings of isolation and dread Borlen endures when he's teased by groups of other dwarves. Fans of Disney's fairy tales will enjoy the slow reveal of how Borlen's crew syncs up with the movie dwarves as well as the subtle setup for a true tale of Rapunzel.

Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Description: This colorful volume is chock-full of fascinating and humorous details. The encyclopedic entries provide information about the life cycles, habitats, diets, and unique characteristics of unusual creatures. Recommended safety measures are also included when applicable since some of these creatures eat children. The inspired format resembles a well-used scrapbook with page edges that look as if they are folded, frayed, and browned. Through a clever and imaginative use of mixed mediums that include ink, pencil, watercolor, oil paint, and Adobe Photoshop, Olander depicts stained and crumpled notebook paper filled with field observations including pictures and diagrams, a reproduction of a 100-year-old wood-panel painting of a Snouted Grabber stealing someone's silver, and archival papyrus scraps. Color is used sparingly to great effect: the blue eyes of a Patooty, fuchsia eyes of a Flesh-Eating Tub Frog, red teeth of a Razor-Twigged Tree Beast, and, of course, the bold, red ""DANGER TO HUMANS"" warnings. The spread that follows the title page includes a brief explanation of the science of monstrology; the key traits of a person who can see a monster, including an open mind; and a list of tools recommended for anyone considering field study.

Geography & Cultures,"Description: In her first book for children, Dupre briefly describes her husband's 3,200-mile expedition around Earth's largest island by kayak, skis and dogsled. She makes the daunting Arctic journey comprehensible for young readers with engaging linoleum block prints that chronicle his trek and by zeroing in on his moving encounter with a raven. Primitivist images with thick black outlines recall the art of the Inuit people that her husband, Lonnie, so admires (""I have watched them make beautiful, warm fur clothing by hand and build perfectly fitted kayaks using only their arms and legs for measuring tools""). Spot illustrations depict indigenous wildlife, such as the narwhal, musk oxen and Arctic tern, while sidebars explain the history of the culture and the land (e.g., ""The Inuit have lived throughout the Arctic regions for more than 3,000 years""). At the center of the volume is the tale of Lonnie's exchange with a raven, a legendary bird in those parts, whose foot was entangled and who allows the man close enough to free it; in the process, the bird gives him renewed resolve: ""Every day I would look for ravens and remember the one who taught me that strength and spirit is in the land, in the sea, and in all living things."" A fitting ode to a rough land and a resilient people. Ages 4-8.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.Gr 2-4-Dupre tells the story of her husband's kayaking trip around Greenland with a friend and his rescue of a raven whose foot had become entangled in musk ox fur-or was it a raven's rescue of Kelly's husband who had become disheartened by his arduous journey? The author illustrates the book with attractive, often humorous, somewhat primitive linoleum-block prints. These prints are the strongest component of the book and certainly are the aspect most likely to draw children's attention. Many of the pages have sidebars giving information about Greenland's wildlife or history. Unfortunately, this is one of those titles that doesn't tell enough about the place to be used for a school assignment and doesn't have a strong enough plot to give it wide appeal as a picture book. For youngsters with a strong interest in arctic regions or a special affinity for ravens, it might prove a treasure.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: PreSchool-Grade 1The trio from Pumpkin Soup (Farrar, 1999) is back again in another gentle tale of friendship and lessons learned. Once again, the animals are concocting their favorite brew of pumpkin soup when they realize that they've run out of salt. Cat announces that he's going shopping when directionally challenged, but headstrong little Duck insists on accompanying him. Cat relents only after Duck promises to hold on tight to avoid getting lost. A concerned Squirrel decides to bring up the rear on the trip to the city. With his friends on either side, Duck spies a pepper shop and decides that the flavoring would be a delicious addition to their soup. Squirrel begs to differ and he and Cat steam off in the direction of the salt shop, unknowingly leaving their distracted friend behind. Reminiscent of the panic of any youngster left alone in unfamiliar territory, Duck, in a terrible tizzy, becomes even more lost. A true-to-life, predictable resolution ensues although heightened by an overblown response by the police and fire departments. Readers will be reassured by this beguiling rendition of a common childhood experience. The rich coloration and expressive representations of the characters raise this story above the ordinary.

Like its predecessor, this companion to Cooper's Pumpkin Soup (1997) offers folksy paintings in spice-cabinet colors and a text that sparkles brightest when read aloud. Duck, Cat, and Squirrel visit town to purchase salt for their trademark pumpkin soup. Duck, the smallest of the trio, ""had a habit of wandering off,"" and it's not long before an enticing window display of peppers catches his attention and he loses his friends in the crowd. A concerned mother hen leads panicky Duck back to the point of separation, while the others retrace their steps to enfold their missing friend in a warm embrace. Some adults may be troubled by Duck's ready acceptance of help from a stranger who is not a police officer, but little listeners will pay less attention to plot specifics than to Cooper's dramatic narrative and warm, dreamlike watercolors.

Similar in format to his Art Is (Millbrook, 2003), the book includes works in various styles, dating from 1450 to 1962.

Opening with Uccellos dramatic St. George and the Dragon followed by Morris Kantors Baseball at Night, he provides identifying captions for each, and also links them with a rhyming word or phrase (Dragon Slayers and Baseball Players) in larger type. The brightly reproduced paintings range in size from full page to three-quarters spread, and a closing section of analytical comments about each invite young viewers to page back for closer looks. The larger pictures cross the gutters with no visible losses. Though Frans Hals puckish Jester with a Lute (Lute Strummers) doesnt quite fit the theme, it does set up the wild jumble of Max Beckmanns ensuing Rugby Players (Rugby Scrummers), and it isnt the only smile-worthy juxtaposition here.

A tense opening line delivered by 52-year-old great white shark biologist Greg Skomal is sure to hook readers: ""It's pretty treacherous right here."" But as they will soon discover, for Skomal and team, the even greater danger is not seeing a great white at all.

Children, as well as their adult friends, will delight in repeating these inhabitants' names over and over again, as they are all entertaining puns and tongue twisters. Packed with useful information, the book is written clearly and simply and will give children an idea of the diversity of jobs. The layout and the humorous and detailed illustrations in this large-format book are reminiscent of those in Richard Scarry's books.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: PopPreS-Gr 2When three friends meet on a rainy day, none can agree on what to play. The first wants to be a royal princess, making royal rules and riding royal unicorns. The second chooses to be a magical fairy, conjuring spells and flying over rainbows. The third prefers to be a ballerina, soaring high above the stage as a graceful swan while an imaginary audience cheers. Even the idea of a contest fails to help them agree, as they argue over whether it should be a flying, throne-sitting, or balancing contest. Angry and disappointed, the girls sulk on opposite corners of the room until the lure of raindrops and puddle stomping entices them to spend the day, hand-in-hand, outside. All ardent fans of anything connected to the regal, magical, and fancifully graceful world of princesses, fairies, and ballerinas will surely gravitate to this story, which further demonstrates how compromise is necessary for any friendship to work. Murguia's gentle pastel colors in varied shades of blue, green, and pink are further enhanced by the sparkly colors on the cover page. One of the most memorable parts of the book is when each friend thrusts forth a symbol of her personal favorite: a blue tiara, a green wand, and a pink toe shoe. There are an abundance of picture books about princesses, fairies, and ballerinas, but fewer that unite all three.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: Dear Amazon Readers:I never really know where my stories come from. I only know where I come from, and thats from a family of morbidly curious people.One of my aunts told me that my grandparents used to take their three daughters to the Greyhound bus station on Friday nights. Theyd watch the passengers coming and going, and make up stories about them. Of course this was in Peoria, Illinois, in the pre-TV era, when entertainment was largely a do-it-yourself proposition.Still, I think the world can be divided into two camps of people: those who come and go and get on with the business of lifeand the rest of us whose business it is to wonder what other people are doing and why and with whom.The 43 Old Cemetery Road series (so numbered because I was 43 years old when I started writing the first book, Dying to Meet You, and couldnt remember a three-digit address) is full of faces and places Ive wondered about over the years. Spence Mansion--home to Ignatius B. Grumply, Seymour Hope, and the ghost of Olive C. Spence--is based on an actual house in Peoria that my sister (and illustrator) Sarah and I rode by on our bikes hundreds of times as a kids. We never knew who lived there--I still dont--but Ive wondered about that place for decades. If I were ghost, I know Id want to hang my hat (or opera glasses) in an old Victorian like that house.And who wouldnt want to write their Last Will and Testament in limericks as Noah Breth does in Till Death Do Us Bark? Ive always loved reading obituaries, especially those of eccentric old millionaires. Theyre the ones who can afford to do the really loony things the rest of us only dream about doing.I consider reading obituaries part of my job as a writer--and as a person, too. I think we have an obligation to be interested in one another; to wonder, as my grandparents wondered, about other peoples lives.So for me, writing fiction is only a small step from watching people at a Greyhound station. The only difference is that the bus station is my desk, and I have to create the passengers and follow them to their final destination, spying all the while, without getting kicked off the bus.Book three in the 43 Old Cemetery Road series finds Seymour taking on an abandoned Irish wolfhound that barks around the clock, much to the dismay of his adoptive parents. While searching for the dogs owner, Seymour encounters the ghost of Noah Breth, an eccentric millionaire who converted his fortune to rare coins in an attempt to teach his unpleasant children a lesson. The Klise sisters have their formula down to a science: a heavily illustrated, comedic/ghostly mystery revealed in a series of letters and documents by a quirky cast whose pun-filled names are truly groanworthy.

Literature & Fiction,"Description: Gr. PreK-1 Though Mary Had a Little Lamb was published in 1830, it seems anything but old-fashioned in this jaunty picture book. Yes, the illustrations feature a one-room schoolhouse out in the country, but the characters clothing and the many touches of fantasy and humor lift the poem out of its historical period and into some timeless, lighthearted landscape of the imagination. All six verses appear, from the very familiar to the nearly forgotten, and each illustrated with one or more double-page pictures that magnify the hilarity in the schoolhouse when the lamb shows off for the class, the sadness that the lamb and Mary feel when he is turned away, and the joy of their reunion. Even the potentially unctuous-sounding ending verse is lightened by the joyous spirit and amusing details in the accompanying illustrations, digital collages combining fabric elements with acrylic and gouache painting. A child-pleasing version of the well-known poem. --Booklist, March 15, 2011Author Sara Josepha Hale is deceased. Hale was an American writer and editor.

Animals,"Description: Jones's charmingly illustrated, engagingly straightforward work retells the beloved Aesop fable about two mice who discover that indeed ""there's no place like home."" As in her earlier peep-hole books, two-inch openings in the center of alternate pages offer tantalizing glimpses of things to come and provide cheery ""backward glances"" at the malcontent mice. With the finely wielded lines of her elaborate pen-and-watercolor art (somewhat reminiscent of John O'Brien's work, though less stylized), Jones opts for a warmer and lighter take on the tale than the cool-toned opulence found in Jan Brett's 1994 rendition. The full-bleed pictures are jammed with amusing details, beginning with a cozily crowded Town Mousehole into which peers a hopeful kitty (while a sign by the lair's exit warns, ""Look left Look right Every night""). Ages 4-8. Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.PreSchool-Grade 2?This well-loved fable benefits from this low-key retelling. Jones enlarges upon the friendship between the two cousins and the myriad dangers that await each mouse when he sets foot on unfamiliar ground. She repeatedly reinforces the moral of the story and concludes with the familiar ""There's no place like home."" Like several of Jones's earlier picture books, this one features die-cut holes on every other page that give readers a hint of the illustration to come. This clever design doesn't work quite as well as it did in Old MacDonald Had a Farm (1989) and This Old Man (1990, both Houghton), but it does allow for plenty of interaction when sharing the book with young children. The full-page pictures are fairly realistic in style and appear to be drawn in pen-and-ink with watercolor washes. The palette emphasizes muted earth tones for the Country Mouse section and a jazzier color scheme for the Town Mouse. While there are other memorable versions of this fable, most notably Janet Stevens's humorous The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse (Holiday, 1987) and Jan Brett's richly detailed Town Mouse, Country Mouse (Putnam, 1994), this rendition deserves a place on library shelves.?Denise Anton Wright, Illinois State University, NormalCopyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.; Title: Town Mouse Country Mouse",1,15521,"[15580, 23243, 33171, 63808]"
Humor,"Description: Lewison ( Shy Vi ; Going to Sleep on the Farm ) and Brown ( Your Best Friend, Kate ) strike a merry chord in this appealing variation on an oft-played theme. Brown's comic ink-and-watercolor pictures depict a medieval princess who looks to be well past the potty-training stage--and who trots out an engaging range of facial expressions that indicate her stubbornness. It seems she has no interest in trading in the ""royal diaper"" for a potty--even when tempted with models that are polka-dotted, musical or glow-in-the-dark. Quite simply, they fail to please her. When the princess's desperate parents consult the royal wise man, he answers--again quite simply--that ""the princess will use the potty when it pleases her to use the potty."" Her incentive proves to be a new acquisition: ""the prettiest pair of pantalettes in the land,"" which, quite simply, cannot be worn with a royal diaper. Art and text convey the tale's message with amusing understatement. Bound to please any princess--and less royal youngsters as well. Ages 2-4. Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.PreSchool-""'This potty doesn't please me,'"" says the princess. Neither does the next one, nor the next. Her parents are frantic with worry-what will the neighbors in the next-door kingdom think? They try everything they can think of, including consulting a wizard. The princess continues to wear her royal diaper until the day she chooses to wear the prettiest pair of pantalettes in the land. When decision time comes, it's the nearest facility that pleases her. This learning experience will be familiar to anyone who has been toilet trained, and a light encouragement to those who haven't. Cheery, full-color cartoons reveal an imagined medieval world in which the anachronistic appearance of a white porcelain commode will disturb only the humorless.

"Arts, Music & Photography","Description: Grade 1-5&ndash;Using a lively version of the children's song This Old Man, this book introduces famous African-American jazz musicians as it counts to nine. Louis Armstrong is number 1. This jazz man, he plays one,/He plays rhythm with his thumb,/With a Snap! Snap! Snazzy-snap!/Give the man a hand,/This jazz man scats with the band. The illustrations give clues to the performers, and the end matter has a biographical sketch for each one. In the final spread, all of the musicians are together, taking bows: These jazz men make one great band! The energetic collage illustrations introduce the action by picturing bold striped curtains encompassing an empty stage set up with jazz instruments; each performer's subsequent spread has striped borders. Onomatopoeic words spill across the pages in imitation of the music's sounds. The book is fun for jazz aficionados and neophytes alike. Children will enjoy the sounds and illustrations and sing along without needing to know more.&ndash;Judith Constantinides, formerly at East Baton Rouge Parish Main Library, LA Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Ehrhardt moves the traditional counting chant ""This Old Man"" to the jazz club in this infectious, rhythmic offering. Each page features a different jazz musician who plays ""rhythm with his thumb,"" makes ""music with his shoes,"" and so on. The rhyming text scans with a smooth, toe-tapping tempo that's nicely extended by the colorful, mixed-media images, arranged in compositions that have their own staccato beat. Bars of striped color slide across page edges, and stylized African American musicians, rendered in geometric shapes and textured prints, send up ""notes that rise to heaven."" Children will want to shout along with the scat-cat rhythms (""Beedle-di-Bop! Bebop!"") that replace the original chant's ""paddy-whack"" refrain and are printed in colorful letters that punctuate the artwork. This will appeal most to preschoolers and kindergarteners, but older children will appreciate the closing section, which reveals that the featured musicians represent real-life jazz legends, including Charles Mingus and Charlie Parker.

While taking the path through the woods to school, Little Bitty Wolf comes across a big, bad girl: Big Red. Each day, while Big Red teases, taunts, and terrorizes Little Bitty, the little wolf tries his hardest not to whine or to whimper. Little Bitty asks his parents what to do, but nothing helps his situation. After his teacher recognizes something is upsetting Little Bitty, she sends him to Mr. Know-It-Owl, the school counselor. Know-It-Owl's advice is to try something ""unexpected."" Little Bitty Wolf decides to simply smile at Big Red the next time she taunts him.

History,"Description: Gr 37""Houston, we have a problem"" is an iconic movie line to most people, and a variation on that very sentence was uttered during the actual Apollo 13 mission. The drama, instigated by a defective thermostat that caused an explosion and oxygen leak, was mirrored back on Earth. Barbara Lovell, the daughter of astronaut Jim Lovell (the mission commander), was aware that her father's job was dangerous; however, during the Apollo 13 mission, she realized something particularly terrible was happening. Mission control in Houston immediately knew the situation was serious and scrambled to help Apollo 13. The safe return of all on board is no secret, but the full story of their trip and how those in space and on land became heroes is a thrilling one, full of heroism and suspense. The author's recounting of the mission is detailed and gives equal coverage to the astronauts, the NASA engineers, and the families. The use of teen Barbara Lovell as a character for readers to identify with is effective and makes the story relatable. Technical language is not absent, but space concepts and tools are explained thoroughly in a manner that even reluctant readers will find accessible.

Michigan rests on sedimentary rocks that reach down into the earths crust more than fourteen thousand feeta depth three-and-a-half times deeper than the Grand Canyon. Within these layers of rock rest all sorts of ancient fossils and minerals that date back to the eras when tropical seas spread across Michigan and hot volcanoes flung molten rock into its skieslong before mile-thick glaciers bulldozed over Michigan and plowed through ancient river valleys to form the Great Lakes.Under Michigan is the first book for young readers about the geologic history of the state and the structure scientists call the Michigan Basin. A fun and educational journey, Under Michigan explores Earths geological past, taking readers far below the familiar sights of Michigan and nearby places to explain the creation of minerals and fossils and show where they can be found in the varying layers of rock. Readers will learn about the hard rock formations surrounding Michigan and also discover the tall mountain ridges hidden at the bottom of the Great Lakes. With beautiful illustrations by author Charles Ferguson Barker, a glossary of scientific terms, and charming page to keep field notes, Under Michigan is a wonderful resource for young explorers to use at home, in school, or on a trip across Michigan.; Title: Under Michigan: The Story of Michigan's Rocks and Fossils (Great Lakes Books)",15,38670,[63135]

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: Kindergarten-Grade 2In this delightful story about life on a farm, an African-American youngster is determined to become the best chicken chaser ever, although Big Mama repeatedly asks her to leave the animals alone. Despite the girl's best efforts, her favorite chicken, Miss Hen, always manages to escape. As the summer days wear on, she finally finds Miss Hen's hiding spot in the tall green grass. She is sitting on a nest with ""fuzzy chicks cuddling tight beneath her wing,"" and although it would be easy to grab her, the child makes a more mature decision and resists the temptation. Harrington uses exceptionally colorful and descriptive language throughout the tale. Miss Hen has feathers as ""shiny as a rained-on roof"" and is as ""plump as a Sunday purse."" Her calls sound ""like pennies falling on a dinner plate."" Jackson's intriguing collages, combining printed cloth with painterly brushstrokes, will have readers lingering over the pages. The birds' feathers are fashioned out of different materials, including fabric, marker pen on loose-leaf paper, newsprint, and lace. Shifting perspectives capture the thrill of the chase as well as the calm of quieter moments. The youngster's face clearly expresses determination, understanding, and pride. This book makes a marvelously delicious read-aloud, accompanied by participatory ""prucks"" and ""squawks"" from the audience.Blair Christolon, Prince William Public Library System, Manassas, VA Copyright Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.*Starred Review* Harrington, whose Going North (2004) was named a Booklist Top of the List--Picture Book, offers another winning book. ""I'm the Chicken-Chasing Queen of Lamar County,"" announces a young African American girl. Gray-haired Big Mama warns her to leave the birds alone, but the girl can't restrain herself: the chase is too much fun, and the elusive Miss Hen is her ultimate prize. When the girl finally manages to sneak up on Miss Hen in the grass, she discovers her prize surrounded by chicks, and the girl instantly reforms: ""I know you're a mama now . . . . I won't trouble your babies."" Both words and pictures elevate a simple story about a girl's sly barnyard game into a rollicking, well-told delight. The words are both colloquial and poetic, and Harrington perfectly balances the tense strategizing and stalking (""I sneaky-hide behind Big Mama's wheelbarrow and make myself small, small, small"") as well as the gentle caring that follows. Jackson's exceptional collages of cut paper, fabric, and paint magnify both the feather-flying action and the characters' emotions, including the loving bond between the girl and Big Mama. Kids will easily feel the irresistible allure of a subversive game as well as the deep bond with an animal friend. A first-rate read-aloud. Gillian EngbergCopyright American Library Association.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: PreS-Gr 2A bright and cheery girl and her grandfather spend a morning teaching each other tai chi and yoga in this sweet, intergenerational picture book. Mei Mei, an adorable girl with pigtails and flair, is curious about the slow dancing that Gong Gong does. She is determined to replicate his actions but instead bursts with energy, creating her own bouncing movements. Mei Mei decides to teach Gong Gong the yoga poses that she learned in school, but his elderly body cannot twist and turn as agilely as hers. In the end, they each assure the other that their movements are ""perfect,"" sending a sweet message that it is the process and the practice that are important. Digitally rendered illustrations place Mei Mei and Gong Gong in a lush backyard garden filled with sunflowers, red maple leaves, and dragonflies. While the background images are repetitive, the focus of the illustrations is on the intergenerational pair. Mei Mei's face expresses a full range of emotions, while Gong Gong's is somewhat one-note. The text is brimming with similes and metaphors describing their movements, and the words follow the actions, with the letters in words such as arched and stretched curving and bending on the page. Descriptions of the movements do not overwhelm the story, and a full set of instructions for the poses, as well as discussions of the practices, are included as back matter. VERDICT This selection stands out from other yoga picture books for its introduction to tai chi and will circulate well in collections where there is an interest in movement, health, and fitness activities.Clara Hendricks, Cambridge Public Library, MAIn a charming outing from newcomer Liu, which won the publisher s 2013 New Voices Award, a girl named Mei Mei gets a backyard tai chi lesson from her grandfather. Gong Gong s movements are graceful and calm, but Mei Mei has a more raucous approach: during the Play the Lute pose, Gong Gong is a musician serenading the sunflowers. Mei Mei [is] a rock star playing guitar for the daisies. Then Mei Mei steps into the teaching role, walking Gong Gong through a few yoga poses. Forshay s polished digital art lends both characters distinctive and contrasting personalities. Closing instructions highlight the tai chi and yoga poses discussed, but the book s sweetness stems from the thoughtful gentleness with which Gong Gong guides Mei Mei, never restraining her natural exuberance. --Publishers Weekly; Title: A Morning with Grandpa",2,67633,"[4111, 4204, 6735, 6810, 9647, 10271, 10882, 11282, 15364, 15842, 16347, 20284, 21109, 21393, 21546, 21955, 22961, 24005, 25152, 27009, 28468, 29295, 29315, 32304, 33358, 33454, 33656, 33981, 34024, 36633, 39609, 39637, 41551, 42022, 45112, 48591, 52436, 52592, 52752, 52930, 53690, 54575, 54644, 55056, 55567, 55854, 55885, 55886, 55939, 57272, 57590, 58229, 58514, 59610, 59834, 61449, 62283, 62297, 65776, 65787, 65795, 65805, 67483, 67635, 68085, 68123, 68204, 68450, 68461, 70242, 70561, 72194, 72448, 72449, 73434, 74553]"

Education & Reference,"Description: Math is a skill that starts out very early in childhood. There are many concepts that toddlers can grasp about math. Some, you may not even recognize as math. But these skills are often developed as play. So, the appropriate books here can help your toddler build up those math skills. Take advantage of this opportunity to help them learn the basics of math.Pre-K is a great age to begin the lessons of number recognition and counting. Like all math skills, you do have to start at the beginning. Practice counting a few of the same items at first. Like many math skills, practice and repetition are the building blocks. While you can eventually move on to higher numbers, you shouldn't expect them always to remember the order that the numbers go in.Shape recognition is another part of math that toddlers can explore. This isaccomplished by explaining the differences and through the play of inserting shapes into the proper holes. It is easy to incorporate this into the every day as you can point out objects through the day and name the shapes. It is also something that they will explore in more depth in preschool.Patterns are another thing that you can start discovering with your toddler. Keep the patterns very simple at first. You can ask or show them what comes next in the sequence. As they develop their skills, you can add a third color or shape. The key is not to overcomplicate your patterns. If at all possible, only make one change in the sequence such as alter the color of an item or the shape of an object. Wait until they get the concept down before trying more complex changes.Size is another math concept that you can explore with your toddler. The idea that things are different sizes is the introduction to the most complicated world of measurements. At this age, you should put emphasis on comparing objects and pointing out which one is different. You can also concentrate on establishing an order of sizes. How big something is might be a little over their heads at this point, because they are still basically comparing everything to themselves.There are many math skills that toddlers can build through play. These skills are the base for more complex math skills later on. While you might not be able to help your teenager with their algebra, you can help your toddler learn the basics of numbers.Author J.

Hopeful that she will find out where it goes, she attaches a note with her name and school. A week later, a church group contacts the school and asks for volunteers to help with its Thanksgiving feast. Dee goes, locates her peas, and makes friends with a homeless boy. The story, while sweet, is contrived and the text is flat. Alternating between double-page spreads and circular vignettes, the appealing watercolor and gouache illustrations depict multiethnic and handicapped characters. Filled with bright colors and smiling faces, they help to move the story along. An additional purchase.Anne Knickerbocker, formerly at Cedar Brook Elementary School, Houston, TXCopyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Pomeranc takes a familiar seasonal tradition--a school food drive--and makes it a lively, appealing story. Dee brings canned peas for the food drive, but she is unwilling to let them go, never to learn where they wind up. She puts a yellow sticky with her name and school on her can, and sure enough, the church that receives her class contribution sends a thank-you note and asks the children whether they would like to volunteer to serve at the Thanksgiving dinner. On Thanksgiving, Dee not only meets a new friend but also makes sure her peas are the star of the meal. Kids will readily identify with the realistic dialogue, engaging story, and Dee's natural curiosity as she wonders what will happen to her donation.

Then a very unusual girl named Darby takes Lily under her wing and they form a two-member group called the Rizzlerunk Club. They have common interests in science, frogs, and trying to stay away from Lily's mom's health food. Things take a bad turn when Darby's previous best friend suddenly returns from a move to England, busting up the duo. Jill has a talent for getting Darby and Lily to do awful things that get them into big trouble with their teachers, the principal, and their friends. Jill always comes out of these incidents smelling like a rose. Lily must decide if she'll keep on being a follower and succumbing to peer pressure in order to stay in the Club or take her parents' advice and make good decisions to be her own person.

Geography & Cultures,"Description: When Henry gets a bee in his bonnet to build a cabin in the woods, his friends all help out--mostly with advice. Henry, a bear character based on 19th-century writer Henry David Thoreau, hears from his pal Emerson as they raise the beams. ""Henry,"" he says, ""your cabin looks too small to eat in!"" But, ""it's bigger than it looks,"" says Henry. He shows Emerson a bean patch he has planted behind the cabin. ""When it's finished, this will be my dining room,"" he explains. A sunny spot beside the cabin will be the library, he tells his friend Alcott, and a path curving down to the pond will be the ballroom with a grand stairway.The many devout fans of author D.B. Johnson's award-winning Henry Hikes to Fitchburg will be tickled to see another title featuring the placid, self-contained Henry. Johnson's kaleidoscopic colored-pencil and paint illustrations are as fascinating as Henry's perspectives on what a home can be. As in his first title, Johnson makes quiet allusions to other luminaries of Thoreau's time, including Ralph Waldo Emerson and Bronson Alcott. (Ages 5 and older) --Emilie CoulterThis worthy sequel to Henry Hikes to Fitchburg rewards repeat visits and inspires a joyful respect for nature. Johnson again conjures the practical spirit of Thoreau and venerates simple living. Walden's chapter on ""Economy,"" complete with a budgeted list of building materials, generates the tale of Henry, a patient bear outfitted in a broad-brimmed farm hat and an outdoorsman's warm clothes. In early spring, with heaps of snow melting on the forest floor, Henry diagrams his dream house, a one-room cabin. ""He borrow[s] an ax and cut[s] down twelve trees,"" hews the pine logs into thick posts for the cabin's frame, and constructs his walls from the weathered boards and windows of ""an old shed."" His thrifty ways and careful measurements indicate his conservationist approach, and his steady progress could inspire a present-day building project. When friends like Emerson and Alcott pronounce the cabin ""too small,"" Henry replies, ""It's bigger than it looks."" He proudly guides them to a vegetable garden (""This will be my dining room"") and a winding path to the pond (""This will be the ballroom""). The conclusion finds Henry happily lolling outdoors in his ""library,"" resting his feet on the windowsill; he gets under his roof only when it rains. Johnson's singular illustrations of the changing seasons exhibit the planed surfaces of cubist paintings. Each scene sparkles as if viewed through multifaceted glass, and eagle-eyed readers will spot New England species like jays, kingfishers, foxes and red squirrels darting around the peripheries.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: Kindergarten-Grade 2This book introduces American coins and paper money in a clear and entertaining way. A group of children from a variety of ethnic backgrounds is hard at work earning money, saving, and planning for a neighborhood clubhouse. Readers see the purchasing power of the different coins and bills in terms of nails, screws, marking pencils, sandpaper, and other building supplies. They also view different ways that coins can be combined to equal a nickel, dime, quarter, dollar, etc. Children will have fun counting the coins and guessing what the next coin or bill will be.

This expansion allows for a more in-depth look than usual, providing space, for example, for the five stages of prayer to be both itemized and displayed photographically.

Classics,"Description: This sophisticated collaboration from the creators of Pish, Posh Said Hieronymus Bosch reinvents a magical tale that is perhaps best known to young readers from Walt Disney's Fantasia. Willard's vivid rhyming text conjures up a fantasy world ruled by old Tottibo, a magician who ""stood so tall his very shadow chilled them all."" Red-haired Sylvia volunteers to be his new assistant and takes on the task of clothing every one of his creatures. From ""bibs well-matched for baby dragons newly hatched"" to ""cloaks to clothe the lesser things,"" Sylvia has a daunting list of garments to sew, and can hardly be blamed for calling on a little magic to speed things up. However, when the newly enlivened sewing machine bares a set of gleaming steel teeth and takes to the air, magical mayhem ensues. The glee-filled text speeds along to a pleasing conclusion, stopping only to challenge the reader with an interesting word choice or image (""a famished stretch of sky""). Distilling the frenzied energy of the text, the Dillons' majestic artwork captures the story's essence and, with its quiet sheen, invokes the timelessness of fairy tales. All ages. Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ages 6-10. The old story of the powerful magician and the awkward apprentice who messes with the magic has been told again and again from ancient Greece to Goethe to Disney's Fantasia. In this version for the 1990s, the apprentice-hero is a confident young woman. With long red hair, checked trousers, and high-heeled clogs, Sylvia comes riding up to the sorcerer's mountain on an old-fashioned large-wheeled bike. As in her 1982 Newbery Medal-winning A Visit to William Blake's Inn, Willard tells her story in lively rhyme that jumps with the unexpected. The Dillons' full-page watercolors, exquisitely drawn in meticulous detail, show domestic uproar just about to burst out of the tight gold frames. In fact, there are a few tiny spot illustrations outside the frame on each page. The sorcerer's house has 57 doors and ""knockers made of gnashing teeth""; there are eyes everywhere, and his creatures are neurotic, brooding, sinister, and clownish. Words and pictures work together perfectly to make us see that chaos is ""very near""; everything is in a state of transformation. The more you look, the more shapes change and slither and leap out as something different. The best scene of all shows the sorcerer ordering the dishes to wash each other (""The spoons leapt up and scrubbed the plates""). He's in control. In contrast, when Sylvia's task is to make clothes for all the creatures, she can't control anything. She's overwhelmed; even the scissors try to bite her hand. In desperation, she pours the sorcerer's potion on the sewing machine--and creates the wildest nightmare. The machine reveals its monstrous teeth: it bursts from the house and hems the trees; it stitches the mountains, snips the moon, bites the sun, until the sorcerer returns and order is restored. In a lovely last line, Willard gives the old cautionary tale a moral for today: Sylvia has learned to turn ""failures into fairy tales.""

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: Gr 3-5-Veronique Vo, nine, yearns for her familiar country home in Normandy after she moves with her family and nanny/housemaid to Paris. Anxiety about starting a new school, making friends, and navigating a strange city is exacerbated when her mother rashly fires Francine and Vero is left in the care of her 12-year-old brother, Philippe, the ""Great Scholar."" Episodic chapters offer humorous situations while furthering the plot, which revolves around the difficulties of life without the nanny and how to get her back. One particularly droll incident involves Mr. Vo's scientific approach to cooking. After several unsuccessful ""trials,"" he resorts to using toothpaste to prepare mayonnaise for the family dinner-with minty results. In other chapters, Vero worries that she has inadvertently poisoned her new friend, trains a pet snail, and fashions her mother's favorite shirt into a doll's dress. Philippe resents being burdened with the care of his little sister and alternately ignores or mocks her. The siblings finally unite with a successful plan to get Francine back.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: The softened watercolor worlds of Henkes's picture books sometimes distract readers from his acute understanding of just how harsh life can be. This awareness is glimpsed in his first novel, Two Under Par, but this new one is even more unflinching and more sensitive. Adine Vorlob doesn't like her Aunt Irene, who has a whiskery moustache and a habit of smoking narrow brown cigarettes, and readers will find it all too easy to dislike Irene, too. But she is moving into Adine's room while the Vorlobs adjust to the new baby, which surprises them all by being a boy (Adine's four other siblings are girls). The arrival of this boy breaks family tradition in many ways, not the least of which is the alphabetical order of the girls' namesAdine, Bernice, Carla, Dot and Effie. This is not another new-baby story; Henkes knows that every worry in a child's life has many layers. He depicts Adine's concerns with depth and sweetly persuasive touches of compassion, treating the thoughts and feelings of a 10-year-old with uncanny justice. Ages 8-up. Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Grade 3-6 Henkes' story presents a lov ing, creative family with Adine Vorlob, a sensitive, intelligent youngster as the main character. The arrival of a sixth child provides the catalyst which helps ten-year-old Adine understand her ec centric and bossy Aunt Irene. As the oldest, Adine has participated in the traditional creation of a special nursery wall to celebrate the first initial of each of her five sisters, all named alphabeti cally from B to E. All of the family is convinced that a sixth female will join the line. The title announces a surpris ing change. Aunt Irene comes to care for the girls while their mother is in the hospital and stays to help out after wards, much to the children's dismay. With her sisters, Adine plots to get Aunt Irene to leave, but in the end learns compassion and understanding. Henkes' characters are well drawn and appealingly unusual. As in Two Under Par (Greenwillow, 1987), he writes with humor about a caring family. Fans of Beverly Cleary and Betsy Byars will enjoy this newest Henkes selection.

Animals,"Description: Troodon. Suchomimus. Carcharodontosaurus. No, these are not rare diseases but rather the names of just a few of the fantastic creatures called dinosaurs that roamed the earth hundreds of millions of years ago. This oversized, full-color picture book approaches the subject with a flair. Artists from around the world painted over 75 illustrations of these diverse creatures, sometimes offering varying perspectives on what the dinosaurs might have looked like. Each painting presents the very latest scientific views on their appearance, but the text emphasizes that no one knows for sure what they looked like, beyond what can be pieced together from fossils. Dinosaurs may even have been brightly colored, like their relatives, lizards and birds.Authors Howard Zimmerman and George Olshevsky chose to divide the book according to dinosaur size and speed, eating habits, and appearance. Scientifically accurate and up-to-date, the text provides the kind of information dinosaur fans really want to know. Discover the strangest looking dinosaurs (including Therizinosaurus, with its two-and-a-half-foot-long curved claws and broad-billed toothless beak), the largest (at up to 170 feet tall, the ""earthshaking lizard"" Seismosaurus is aptly named), and the deadliest (the smart, speedy, saw-toothed Velociraptor was one dinosaur you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley). This book has 'em all, from the Triassic to the Jurassic to the Cretaceous periods. (Ages 7 and older) --Emilie CoulterGrade 2-5-Dramatic illustrations of awesome dinosaurs rank this book several notches above the average. Zimmerman groups his dinosaurs mostly by physical characteristics in chapters with headings such as ""The Biggest Meat Eaters,"" ""The Strangest-Looking Dinosaurs,"" and ""The Last Dinosaurs."" There's a fair amount of information about each creature, and pronunciation guides for names like Pachycephalosaurus. The author includes facts about newly discovered animals such as the Suchomimus, a dinosaur with a huge, crocodilelike mouth. Pictures dominate, and the tall, oversized format is perfect for displaying these gigantic creatures. A towering Tyrannosaurus actually looks like it could eat 500 pounds of meat in one bite. The book often offers several artists' takes on the same animal, showing how appearance, color, and anatomy are still open to interpretation. An intriguing portrayal of some amazing creatures.

In rhyming phrases a young boy considers: When I grow up, what shall I be? / Of all the many, many jobs, which one will be the best for me?
