Geography & Cultures,"Description: The author and artist teamed for Buzz return for this carefully honed story about a girl's experience as a first-generation Chinese-American. Readers first encounter the unnamed narrator as she looks unhappily out the glass door of her parents' market, open for business even on the Fourth of July. Hearing the ""boom, boom, boom"" of the approaching parade, sniffing the apple pie baking in a neighbor's oven, she is distracted by the cooking smells from the store's kitchen, where her parents are preparing chow mein and sweet-and-sour pork. ""No one wants Chinese food on the Fourth of July,"" she tries to explain, and her prediction seems right as the afternoon lengthily unfolds with almost no customers. ""My parents do not understand all American things,"" she reminds herself, ""They were not born here."" But the evening brings a steady stream of patrons, and the holiday concludes with the family watching fireworks (invented by the Chinese) and eating what else? apple pie. The well-paced text heavily freighted at the beginning and swift by the end reflects the girl's changing emotions and moods. The art resembles cut-paper collage. Chodos-Irvine deploys sharply defined objects in a range of colors and patterns to construct harmonious, forthright compositions that will likely prove inviting to readers of many backgrounds. Ages 3-7. Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.Kindergarten-Grade 2-This simply told story explores a child's fears about cultural differences and fitting in with understanding and affection. A Chinese-American girl helps her parents open their small neighborhood grocery store every day of the year. However, today is the Fourth of July and her parents just don't understand that customers won't be ordering chow mein and sweet-and-sour pork on this very American holiday. As she spends the day working in the store and watching the local parade, she can't shake her anxiety about her parents' navet. When evening arrives along with hungry customers looking ""for some Chinese food to go,"" she is surprised but obviously proud that her parents were right after all: Americans do eat Chinese food on the Fourth of July. Nighttime finds the family atop their roof enjoying fireworks and sharing a neighbor's apple pie. Done in a ""variety of printmaking techniques,"" Chodos-Irvine's illustrations are cheerfully bright and crisp, capturing the spirit of the day as well as the changing emotions of the main character.

History,"Description: Grade 5-9-In her introduction, Fleming says that she set out to write a straightforward biography of one of America's most forward-thinking and inventive statesmen but found the form to be too restrictive and not true to Franklin's wide-ranging interests and accomplishments. She has written instead a compendium of ""-bits and pieces by subject"" put into eight chapters with headings such as ""Boyhood Memories"" and ""Tokens of a Well-Lived Life."" In scrapbook style, the chapters are centered around excellent-quality visuals-portraits, etchings, cartoons, and sketches-linked together with engrossing text and numerous nuggets of Franklin's prose, which include his reminiscences and observations. The result is an authoritative work of depth, humor, and interest, presenting Franklin in all his complexity, ranging from the heroic to the vulgar, the saintly to the callous. Read cover to cover, the book gives a three-dimensional picture of a life, but it is equally good for dipping into and turning up the interesting anecdote or bit of wisdom, thus appealing to both serious readers and browsers. Beginning with a year-by-year chronology, the volume also includes lengthy bibliographies, a list of picture sources, Web sites, and a thorough index. Reminiscent of Franklin's own Poor Richard's Almanack, this book is a superlative example of the biographer's craft and a fitting tribute to the gentleman himself.Ann Welton, Grant Elementary School, Tacoma, WACopyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 6-9. There's no shortage of books on Franklin, but this biography, which springs from Fleming's lifelong fascination with the multitalented man, is unlike anything that has come before, and it bears no resemblance to Fleming's picture-book work. Designed more like a scrapbook than an almanac, it's a visually rich but densely packed amalgamation of anecdotal narrative, boxed insets, black-and-white reproductions of period documents and artwork, and material obtained from Franklin's personal papers--all organized into topical chapters on Franklin's family life, writings, scientific pursuits, and political involvement. The whole gives an excellent sense of the time in which Franklin lived, but the thematic organization here sacrifices continuity and leaves occasional gaps. The science section is perhaps the best as it falls neatly into invention-specific discussions. Lively anecdotes greatly expand the main text, and numerous quotes by and about Franklin give the man a truly human face, even as they raise questions that continue to puzzle historians. A fitting tribute to a ""good gentleman"" whose life was well and energetically lived. Web sites and further readings are appended. Stephanie ZvirinCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Description: Before I started writing fiction, I unleashed my creativity through photography and digital art.The photograph used on the cover ofFaustinewas taken while my younger daughter, Lauren, was doing her homework. Lauren was so engrossed by her work that she didn't notice when I reached over for my camera. Later on when I was flipping through the pictures I had taken, I stopped at one of them, it drew me in and stayed with me. It's this photograph that inspired the whole Bonfire Chronicles series.I had no idea what the series would be about when I started writing. I played around with the photograph on Photoshop, messing around with the eye color, and the name Faustine popped into my head. I suddenly had a title for my photograph, which was now of a girl with red eyes... a vampire, perhaps? I had no idea who she was, or what she was when I started writing. The ""Who is Faustine?"" was very much a question for myself.Once I had finished the book, I sent it to my then agent. She read it and felt that the stronger story would be the one precedingFaustine, that of her days at Bonfire Academy. I was thrown a little, having no desire to write a story from a twelve-year-old's voice. But as I was thinking, I imagined seeing Faustine walk into Bonfire Academy. I saw her from afar and high up, like I was looking down a window. It then struck me that the next story was not going to be written from Faustine's point of view, but from someone observing her--Cordelia was born, and the two prequel books (InitiationandIntegration) were written.We were then back in the present again. However, it wasn't as simple as continuing Faustine where I had initially left off. I now had to take into consideration all the events in the prequel books as well as the fact that Cordelia had her own following. Fans of the series wanted more Cordelia!Uprisingfollows on, not just fromFaustine, but also from the two prequel books.

Gage and his family move to the house after the boy becomes sick. There are rules to help the children get better, including ""no puppies!"" In a nearby town, a litter of puppies is born. Two of them become service dogs, three train for Search-and-Rescue, and four are groomed for the show ring. Mogie, however, fails at each of these endeavors because he breaks all the rules. This is why he does so well at the Ronald McDonald House. He walks right in and meets Gage. Slowly, Mogie helps him feel better. The boy eventually gets to go home, but there are more children there for Mogie to help. This heartwarming story will satisfy animal lovers and anyone who enjoys a happy ending. The illustrations, rendered in pencil and charcoal, and digitally, complement the story. Mogie is adorable; it's no wonder that he has a positive affect on Gage and the other children. The book makes good use of negative space, and page layouts vary to keep visual interest. This title would work well as a read-aloud and as an excellent choice for independent reading.Emily E. Lazio, The Smithtown Special Library District, NYMogie, a labradoodle with a trademarked name who lives at the Ronald McDonald House in Houston, has his story fictionally told by a Newbery Honor Book author and a cartoon-style illustrator. Into a very special house wanders this ball-chasing, tail-wagging, moon-howling pup who, while seemingly not cut out for other canine careers, bonds instantly with Gage, a representative blond-haired boy at the house who has lost his mojo. The two become fast friends, and once Gage finally recovers from his unstated illness and moves out, Mogie turns his affection to Antonia, who has lost her cha-cha-cha. The appended authors note tells of Appelts own bonding with Mogie and his role at the Ronald McDonald House, the mission of which is only vaguely alluded to except for on the flap copy.

Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Description: Gr 3-5-Japanese-American fourth-grader Akiko continues the interplanetary quest begun in Akiko on the Planet Smoo and Akiko in the Sprubly Islands (both Delacorte, 2000). With her odd assortment of companions, she is following Queen Pwip's instructions to find and rescue the lost prince Froptoppit. Based on a Japanese comic-book series, the episodic plot follows the company across the planet Smoo, as they encounter various weird creatures and strange obstacles. The book does not stand on its own, but takes up right where Islands left off. First, the adventurers have to surmount an enormous wall that stands across their path. Then they must cross a miles-long bridge with a long-abandoned restaurant in the middle. Throughout the story, they are warned of the coming of a mysterious villain; however, when he finally shows up, Akiko's disk-creature companion sends him away with little fuss. There is no plot resolution. The action simply stops abruptly-apparently to be continued in the next volume. The original graphic-novel format is reflected in the amusing black-and-white cartoons. The rivalry among the group members provides some humorous moments and the bizarre features of Smoo are intriguing. Akiko herself is a strong female character whose leadership holds her strange band together. However, this story will be confusing to readers unfamiliar with the previous books.-Elaine E.

Her readable text touches on eight Cretaceous dinosaurs, from smallish Psittacosaurus to gigantic Argentinosaurus, describing fossil finds of eggs and embryos, nesting colonies, and possible/probable parenting scenarios. The full-color illustrations are realistic (but not photographic in style) and depict a variety of big-eyed babies, from freshly hatched Saltasaurus facing an uncertain future on their own, to young Maiasaura being fed in their nest, to a T. rex guarding a smelly mound of vegetation covering her eggs.

Literature & Fiction,"Description: A journey with Naomi Shihab Nye and Dan Yaccarino is impossible to resist. Sixteen luminous poems by Nye are accompanied by Yaccarino's stunning mixed-media collages. Nye, poet, novelist, essayist, and anthologist, writes of journeys--internal and external, short and long, slow and fast. Her poetry invites readers to sail away, to rejoice in the journey as well as the destination, and to notice everything along the way. Yaccarino, award-winning artist, and illustrator of Circle Dogs, Deep in the Jungle, An Octopus Followed Me Home, and others, crafts unusual and compelling collages to lose oneself in. His rich use of color, texture, and pattern complements Nye's deeply layered, absorbing poems. This is a collection to cherish. (Ages 4 and older) --Emilie CoulterNye (editor of Salting the Ocean) challenges readers with a range of her own poems, linked thematically as an investigation of journeys to inner spaces as well as literal journeys to real and imagined places. In ""Mad,"" a girl flies to the moon to escape her mother, but when it gets cold at night, slides down the silver thread her mother sends up because ""She knows me so well./ She knows I like silver."" An airplane pilot in ""Full Day"" says, ""In one minute and fifty seconds/ we're going as far/ as the covered wagon went/ in a full day,"" and the poet further contrasts the experiences of modern travelers and pioneers. Yaccarino's (Circle Dogs) imaginative, abstracted mixed-media collages tend to distance the audience from the emotions or characters presented in the poems, but wisely leave readers free to interpret Nye's meanings for themselves. Both the poems and the illustrations vary widely in their accessibility. The title poem, for example, lauds the ""quiet minute between two noisy minutes/ It's always waiting ready to welcome us/ Tucked under the wing of the day."" The more abstruse ""Envelope"" begins, ""The sky sends a letter to the ground."" Chock-full of unexpected images, the poems are occasionally marred by cryptic or portentous metaphors (e.g., ""Are you hooked to the slightest movement/ of a girl by the Arctic Sea?""). On balance, however, the journey through this volume is a rewarding one. Ages 5-up. (Sept.)

She explains that a chocolate bar was most likely made with cacao beans harvested by exploited workers, and that a cell phone contains enough heavy metals to seriously harm our groundwater. She covers (un)fair labor practices, environmental pillaging, factory farming, excessive marketing, local vs. corporate stores, and the pervasive throwaway mentality that drives the whole cycle.

Mysteries & Detectives,"Description: The Happy Hollisters by Jerry West was actually written by Andrew E. Svenson, a prolific yet somewhat anonymous, writer of books for children. Jerry West was the pen name assigned to Svenson when he started writing The Happy Hollisters for the Stratemeyer Syndicate, a book packager well-known for its development of children's book series including Tom Swift, The Bobbsey Twins, The Hardy Boys, and Nancy Drew. Many of these series were intended to have long publishing lives, and were written by multiple authors using the same pseudonym. The Happy Hollisters, however, were all written by Andrew Svenson, whose identity as Jerry West was kept secret until several years after his death in 1975. Andrew Svenson was born in Belleville, NJ, in 1910, and his interest in writing started early. He was editor of his high school newspaper and yearbook at Barringer High School in Newark, and then went on to study Creative Writing at the University of Pittsburgh. After his graduation in 1932, he worked as a reporter and editor for the Newark Star Eagle and the Newark Evening News. During this time, Andrew Svenson was encouraged by his friend and co-worker Howard Garis (author of Uncle Wiggily) to try his hand at juvenile fiction. Svenson joined the Stratemeyer Syndicate in 1948, where he contributed to established series as Franklin W. Dixon (The Hardy Boys) and as Laura Lee Hope (The Bobbsey Twins). The first volume in The Happy Hollisters was published in 1953 by Doubleday &amp; Company, and he was made a partner in the Stratemeyer Syndicate in 1961. As he wrote and developed 33 titles in The Happy Hollisters, he was also creating additional series for children under other pen names: Bret King by Dan Scott and The Tollivers by Alan Stone, the first series written for and about African-American children. Andrew Svenson wrote more than 70 adventure and mystery novels for children, which were published in 17 languages and sold millions of copies. The Hollister family was modeled on his own family and he often used Svenson family events and travels as the foundation for The Happy Hollisters books. He also kept copious newspaper clippings for story ideas, and interviewed hundreds of school children and teachers for additional suggestions. These ideas were worked into his storylines, adding an educational element that was appreciated by parents and educators alike.

Elle Woods is a frumpy sophomore when something no, someone catches her eye during a basketball rally at the well-heeled Beverly Hills High School. It's handsome Hunter Perry, star of the school's basketball team, and as he pleads for student support for it, Elle's heart swells and she determines to win his affections by helping their losing team become better. Never mind that she previously had no interest whatsoever in basketball or cheerleading, for that matter. But Elle notices that the cheerleaders are constantly with Hunter, even though their half-hearted, pathetic attempts at creating school spirit fall on deaf ears. What's a girl to do? Well, determined Elle has plans. She kisses goodbye to her frumpy image by getting her braces removed, orders contact lenses and a whole new wardrobe, and gets lots of blonde highlights. Suddenly, people start noticing her. Then, with the help of her manicurist, she choreographs new routines for the cheerleaders and designs sharp new uniforms for them. Elle's butler, conveniently a former basketball star, teaches the team to work together. It appears that Elle's plan is succeeding, but Hunter still doesn't seem to notice. How can she win his heart? The happy ending proves that Elle's not only beautiful on the outside, but on the inside as well.

This candy-pink paperback debuts the Elle Woods series, a spin-off of the 2001 film Legally Blonde, which was based on the novel by Amanda Brown. Mousy, bespectacled Elle, 16, may not look like the deceptively ditzy character played by actress Reese Witherspoon, but there are glimmers of an inner go-getter in Elle's plan to restore glory to her school's lame basketball team, a gambit to impress its sexy captain. Inspiration for budding feminists is in short supply here, as Elle's achievement of her goals is inextricably tied to her gussied-up physical appearances (including blonde highlights, ""an expression of [her] true spirit""), and fans of the movie may emerge newly aware of how much Witherspoon's charismatic presence contributed to its success. Even so, many readers--even those unfamiliar with the Elle Woods character--will be entertained by the smart, likable girl's transformation from ""Planet Schlub"" to ""Planet Glam."" Notwithstanding its high-school setting, the book's large type and air of sanitized innocence will play best to middle-graders. Jennifer MattsonCopyright American Library Association.

Education & Reference,"Description: Gr 58A tribute to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg that does more than catalog her achievements; it conveys her spirit, one that will leave readers in awe. Widely viewed as a champion for women's rights, Ginsburg is quick to correct that she battles for ""women's and men's liberation,"" as best illustrated in the case of Stephen Wiesenfeld, who was prevented from collecting his dead wife's social security due to his gender. Ginsburg accepted the case to argue that equality under the law benefits both sexes, and shrewdly, to set a precedent. Not only are her professional triumphs lauded, and our justice system explained, the authors do an excellent job of rounding out her rich life: wife in an egalitarian marriage, mother, and close friends with her polar opposite on the bench, Justice Scalia. The one misstep is the clumsy handling of the justice's cancer, introduced as ""her struggle."" Young readers may need more clarification. However, the book's strengths far overshadow this stumble.

He was sick of story books and wanted something a bit more challenging"". As the author of a few heavy historical novels he started writing children's books for the boys not long after Will was born. Being boys they wanted adventure and scary dragons. But after Jack and Thomas arrived Jack wanted to read 'real' books about 'real' things, not pretend stuff. Not being able to find suitable books written to the capacity of a 4 or 5 year old, he started making little flip books on his computer and using pictures from magazines and photographs in his collection. He sent one of these books to his publisher who thought this a great idea and has since commissioned a series of books for this age group. With the help of the boys he is currently working on several picture books about our land and sea animals. Lionel lives with his family, Billy the bitser, cats Ghost and Patch and assorted lizards and insects in Ho-Ho-Kus, a suburb of New York (Northern New Jersey-Long Island).; Title: Guide Dogs!

Animals,"Description: Kindergarten-Grade 2All the sheep shearers at Shaggy Gully have sheep dogs with names like Brute, Tiny, and Fang. A new shearer, Shaun, arrives with a sheep-sheep named Pete, who rounds up the animals with polite requests and compliments. Soon the sheep will only respond to Pete, and allow only Shaun to shear them. When the other shearers insist that they must go, Shaun opens a salon in town, styling the sheep's wool in innovative ways. When Brute, Tiny, and Fang desert their owners to have their fur styled, the other shearers finally join the salon and spend their time styling animals of all shapes and sizes. The creators of Diary of a Wombat (Clarion, 2003) have produced a bit of harmless, silly fluff that, while mildly amusing, is hardly likely to inspire rereading. Whatley's watercolor-and-colored-pencil illustrations are clean and crisp and work nicely with the text, but there is simply not much substance here.Grace Oliff, Ann Blanche Smith School, Hillsdale, NJ Copyright Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.PreS-Gr. 1. In this Australian import, three sheep shearers, Ratso, Big Bob, and Bungo, are proud of their sheepdogs, but their coworker, Shaun, has a new idea about the way to herd. Pete, his sheep, very politely does the work, and then Shaun, an excellent shearer, gives them the cut. All the sheep love the duo, which angers Ratso, Big Bob, and Bungo, who give Shaun and Pete the boot. Shaun spends his time shearing Pete, and comes up with a hairstyle so divine, he opens a barbershop, specializing in sharp haircuts for sheep. Before long, the shop is so busy, Ratso, Big Bob, and Bungo join up as barbers. This is one extended joke, but the text is so jaunty and the artwork so amusing, it's hard to mind. Most of the fun in the ink-and-watercolor drawings comes from the expressions on the sheeps' faces--and, of course, their wild and wacky haircuts. Good for story hours.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: PreSchool-Good toilet training books seem as scarce as a clean public restroom in Times Square, and, unfortunately, this book won't alleviate the problem. A parade of needy children is joined by a group of wise mice that guides the youngsters to the bathroom and back. Encouraging phrases will assist reluctant children: ""Don't Panic! Don't Fret! And please don't ignore it! Now is your chance to show how BIG you are!"" Reminders to use toilet paper, flush, and wash hands are included. A final message reassures, ""Don't worry if you don't get it right the first time-you'll get another chance."" The book's benefits are overshadowed by the busy and possibly confusing illustrations. Large, bold type is set word by word into flags, banners, and signs held by the small creatures. When one child arrives in the bathroom, the toilet lid is covered with a well-meaning but unfortunately placed mouse band. While libraries will be able to work around the chart on the inside of the dustjacket and the page of (unattached) stickers that will allow children to record their successes, these features make the book most useful for home libraries.Bina Williams, Bridgeport Public Library, CTCopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.PreS. This good-natured book, by the author of Don't Let the Pigeons Drive the Bus [BKL S 1 03], uses just the right tack for kids who theoretically understand toilet use, but still have misgivings about it in practice. Potty trainees will delight in reviewing bathroom procedures alongside a cast of worried-looking boys and girls and a pep squad of encouraging mice. Willems again demonstrates a genius for spare but expressive lines and an almost uncanny rapport with the preschool audience. The plainspoken text, which appears in placards raised cheerleader-style by the mice, offers pithy instructions (""Boys can stand. Girls should sit"") and assurances (""It won't take long"") that get right at the heart of kids' concerns. There's no real story, and true to its title, the book deals only with one bodily function. But, never mind; it will still go a long way toward easing the anxiety surrounding this developmental hurdle. Each copy comes with a chart on the flip side of the book jacket and reward stickers for home use, but don't let that stop you from putting it on the library shelf.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: Sensitive, yet straight to the point. Jayneen Sanders has written the perfect book to start critical conversations between parent and child about consent and respect. Dr Justin Coulson PhD www.happyfamilies.com.auJayneen (aka Jay Dale) is an experienced early years educator, author and publisher. She started her teaching career in the 1980s as a primary school teacher in rural Australia. She then moved to Melbourne and taught at a number of inner-city schools. In 1985, Jay had a change of career and became an educational editor and publisher. In the early 90s, Jay and her partner moved to Japan to work as English teachers. They lived and worked in Japan for over three and a half years. In fact, Jay's first daughter was born there. On returning to Australia, Jay began work as an educational author/packager. Since that time, she has authored and produced numerous award-winning titles for the educational publishing industry. Jay is also an accomplished children's book author, writing a number of titles for such literacy series as ZigZags, Totally Kidz, Deadly and Incredible, and a children's picture book series for Penguin. She is currently working with an educational publisher as lead author of a literacy series. Jay has written over 100 titles in that series. Jay is a mother of three daughters and was a school councillor at her local school for over seven years. This time spent in schools both as a teacher and a parent inspired her to ask the question of her community: 'What are we doing in schools to protect our children from unsafe touch?' When she realised very little was actually being done, she decided to use her authoring and publishing skills to write Some Secrets Should Never Be Kept to help parents, carers and teachers to broach the subject of self-protection and to encourage children to speak up. After the encouraging response to Some Secrets Should Never Be Kept, she realised there was a need to further build upon the idea of children not keeping secrets about unsafe touch. Jay participated in Protective Behaviours professional development and attended numerous conferences on the topic to educate herself in how to keep children safe and provide them with prevention education. Jay then went on to develop and publish a comprehensive Body Safety and Respectful Relationship Teacher's Resource Kit as well as writing several more children's books on the topics of Body Safety, consent, respect, body boundaries and gender equality. Jay's ongoing passion for the safety and empowerment of children continues today with new manuscripts and free-to-download Body Safety resources always in the wings.; Title: Let's Talk About Body Boundaries, Consent and Respect: Teach children about body ownership, respect, feelings, choices and recognizing bullying behaviors",2,73174,"[2817, 6238, 6391, 7556, 10516, 19538, 21106, 21411, 21955, 32099, 32461, 32484, 32707, 33863, 34076, 36442, 37757, 41481, 41960, 42632, 42911, 44166, 44297, 44590, 45085, 45116, 45222, 46903, 57523, 61638, 61650, 66919, 66921, 66924, 68071, 68120, 70360, 70514, 70679, 71025, 71891, 72163, 72272, 73067, 73081, 73175, 73178, 73179, 73180, 73181, 73182, 73256, 73257, 73539, 73906, 75157, 75375, 75743]"

Education & Reference,"Description: ""Cleary and Gable's cool cats tackle the topic of time. 'Time can be measured in seconds, in minutes, in days, or in weeks, months, or years / by watches or calendars, cell phones, computers, or clocks that ticktock with their gears.' Beginning with seconds, Cleary tackles each of these time measurements (as well as hours and decades), describing the things that can be done in each--four rounds of the birthday song might take a minute, for instance, while 'If you rode your bike or you skated an hour, your legs would sure have to be strong!'--and how they compare to the others, i.e., seven days in a week and 60 minutes in an hour. Some of these explanations are better than others, though; the description of the number of days in a month is scant, and only February is mentioned (as having 28 days, 29 every four years). Cleary's rhyming verses sometimes limp along, throwing off both meaning and rhythm to match the rhyme scheme. Gable's cats are as full of personality as ever, and there are humorous situations aplenty in his artwork, though time is quite a tricky concept to try to illustrate.

Animals,"Description: PreSchool-KA young beaver climbs onto a narrow log and floats away from his family. He ends up lost in a vast city where he is chased by a dog, encounters a fake alligator in a swimming pool, passes through the Beaver Exhibit at the zoo, and swims across a lake. The animal emerges onto a crowded street where he follows a mouse down a long flight of stairs to a bay. He swims across the large expanse of water and reaches home late at night, where his family is waiting. This is basically a wordless story, told frame by frame in pictures. The watercolor and ink illustrations are mostly done in soft browns, beiges, and pastels. Youngsters should enjoy following Beaver's trek as he searches for home, perhaps telling the story in their own words.Donna Atmur, Los Angeles Public Library Copyright Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.In this wordless picture book, the action begins when a beaver jumps on a log in a river and the log is picked up by a crane, stacked on a truck, and driven to a city. On arrival, the beaver explores the streets, escapes both a big dog and then a crocodile in a zoo, hides in a sewer, and then finally returns to the river, where he swims through the night and reaches home. The finely detailed, watercolor-and-pencil pictures are always true to the small creature's viewpoint, whether he is on the highway watching the skyscrapers whiz by or on the city sidewalk among the gray-clad legs of crowds of giants, and young children will easily recognize their own perspective. Drawn by the exciting adventure of leaving home, getting lost, and returning safely, kids will enjoy poring over the busy scenes and pointing out what they notice.

At other times, though, Jerome and Duffy are afraid, act out at school, or have accidents. Bedwetting is handled in a calm manner. Dad says, ""That's okay, Jerome. That's why God invented washing machines and bathtubs."" Jerome worries about himself and Duffy, who acts as something of a surrogate for Jerome's own experiences. The text is positive about Dad, but the watercolor illustrations oddly distance him. He is rarely shown with Jerome and never with the whole family. The focus is on Jerome, Duffy, and Mom almost exclusively. The pictures reflect the sentimental tone by showing everything as clean, pretty, and sunny. Even the difficult times do not appear very threatening. In a storm scene Jerome is asleep; when he gets in trouble at school, the picture is of him sitting in the principal's office rather than the fight itself. The story ends with Jerome anticipating rather than experiencing his mother's homecoming. By not having a tidy conclusion, the author leaves the story a bit open and more relatable for children who are also still waiting for the return of a loved one.&mdash;Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christopher's School, Richmond, VA Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A ""Choose your tools"" box illustrates the supplies needed (pastel pencil, crayon, watercolor, fine-tip marker, colored pencil, marker, poster paint). An outline map (that does not identify the continents) indicates where the types of dragons originated. Detailed drawings of 11 creatures (Aboriginal Rainbow Serpent, Lambton Wyrm, Chinese Imperial Dragon, etc.) require anywhere from 12 to 50 steps to complete. The technique is similar to the method used in Lee J. Ames's books, but Masiello includes boxes with additional drawing ideas for fish scales, Maya patterns and shapes, a treasure chest, and so on, and a paragraph of facts about each dragon. The glorious, fire-breathing creatures depicted nearly leap off the page.Augusta R. Malvagno, Queens Borough Public Library, NY Copyright Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.In this handsome, large-format book, Masiello introduces 11 traditional beasts and shows how to draw them. For each, he provides a series of detailed drawings that build up to the finished pictures slowly, guiding young artists line by line. Masiello uses the term dragon broadly to include Ouroboros and the cockatrice as well as more traditional forms such as Fafnir, the Aboriginal Australian Rainbow Serpent, and the Chinese imperial dragon. By closely following the series of drawings, with the new lines in red, an aspiring artist of even modest talent could end up with a respectable representation of a dragon. After two to eight wordless pages of step-by-step drawings, the finished picture appears, brightened with brilliant colors and accompanied by a paragraph discussing the beast.

"Arts, Music & Photography","Description: Grade 2-5This offbeat picture book blends facts with bits of quirky, occasionally amusing speculation. Beginning with the composer's birth in 1770 (the wild-haired infant cries to the tempo of his famed Fifth SymphonyWah Wah Wah Wah), Winter reveals that the adult Beethoven lived in 39 different apartments in and around Vienna. If readers wonder why he relocated so often, the tongue-in-cheek text cites such reasons as forgetting to pay rent, the hideous stinky smell from a nearby cheese shop, and noise complaints from other residents. Beethoven brings his five legless pianos to each new abode, a constant headache for his movers, who always find the most roundabout and preposterously difficult way of transporting the instruments from place to place. Silly examples of evidence (e.g., we know that Beethoven played his pianos loudly because of the Hundreds of cotton balls with traces of dried earwax found in neighbors' homes) are mixed with nuggets of truth (the maestro's increasing deafness). The pen-and-ink and watercolor cartoon illustrations depict the frazzled-looking composer and play up the text's humor. Unfortunately, the joke begins to wear thin, and the abrupt, anticlimactic conclusion may disappoint readers who manage to stick with the book until the end. There is not much here to capture the interest of those unfamiliar with Beethoven's life and work. While young classical music buffs might enjoy this banal tale, it won't have much to say to most children.Joy Fleishhacker,School Library Journal Copyright Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Gr. 3-5. Winter first states the basic facts: Ludwig van Beethoven was born in Germany, owned five legless pianos, and moved 39 times. From there, ""things get fuzzier"" about the life of the wild musical genius. Why did he move? Did his tormented neighbors drive him out because of the noise? Did they really write him a note telling him to ""Shut . . . up""? It's not clear who the audience is for this mock picture-book biography; Winter's wry send-up of scholars' pretentious attempts to document the ""facts"" about the situation is strictly for adults. But Blitt, who illustrated Geoffrey Kloske's Once Upon a Time, the End (2005), uses his line-and-watercolor cartoons to extend the great parody of the tormented-genius stereotype, and the picture-book crowd will surely relish the humor of the famous, noisy neighbor and the furniture movers schlepping all those pianos.

History,"Description: Grade 3-6-A solid, approachable introduction to the often amazing story of the Panama Canal, complete with full-color illustrations and historical photos. Mann traces the starts and stops of the undertaking from its French origins to its completion by the Americans, fueled throughout by the labor of workers from all over the world. The construction of the canal, with its locks and dams, is not an easy subject to relate. However, the author manages to render the technical language in the simplest of terms. She also addresses the unfair working and living conditions of the many laborers from the Caribbean. A pull-out illustration of how the canal works is included. Tim McNeese's The Panama Canal (Lucent, 1997) is more thorough, but for younger readers, Mann's book more than suffices.Carol Fazioli, The Brearley School, New York City, NYCopyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Mann (The Great Wall, 1997, etc.) offers the older end of the picture-book set a concrete, engaging narrative on another of the man-made wonders of the world. Opening her tale with the failure of the French, under Ferdinand de Lesseps, to construct their own canal in Panama, Mann quickly moves into the details of President Teddy Roosevelt's obsession with the project; he broke international law by encouraging and aiding Panama's rebellion for independence in 1903. The resulting treatythough unfair to Panamagave Roosevelt all the leverage he needed, and despite yellow fever and malaria, America soon poured thousands of workers and millions of dollars into this enterprise. While there were excellent living conditions for American workers in Panama, those conditions were not duplicated for Caribbean laborers: ``Black Caribbeans suffered a higher rate of death from accidents and disease than any other group.'' Rangel's lavish full-color illustrations capture the immense scale of the canal's construction, from the damming of the Chagres River to the construction of the locks on a four-page, fold-out spread. Mann and Rangel have created an exceptional resource for the classroom, as well as an epic piece of storytelling.

Geography & Cultures,"Description: Grade 4-6-Accessible books about topics that are studied in most elementary schools. The information on housing, storage, village structure, and family life is straightforward, easy to read, and interesting, although life on the Plains seems less harsh than existence really was. The texts are peppered with full-color illustrations-at least one to a page-that depict Native Americans in historical times engaged in daily activities such as eating, storytelling, and building lodges. There are no source notes, and the glossary has no pronunciation guide. The illustrations are uneven. Some are reminiscent of 18th-century romantic paintings, some are contemporary, and some are just plain bad. For example, along with works by quality contemporary artists Howard Terpning and James Bama there are others where facial features are so poorly rendered that it is difficult to distinguish one person from another. The books are generally good, but the illustrations do them a great disservice. Michael Bad Hand Terry's Daily Life in a Plains Indian Village 1868 (Clarion, 2001) is a better choice because it uses real-life models to show actual clothing and articles used by Plains Indians.Dona J.

Biographies,"Description: Grade 1-4This inspiring biography of Clayton ""Peg Leg"" Bates, who lost his left leg in a cottonseed mill accident in 1919 at the age of 12, chronicles the man's amazing life from his days as the son of a sharecropper in South Carolina to his rise to fame as a tap dancer. His special step, the American Jet Plane, in which he ""tapped across the stage, leaped five feet into the air, and landed on his peg leg with the other leg straight out"" won over black and white audiences alike. Still, he was never allowed to eat or sleep in the same restaurants and hotels enjoyed by white vaudeville performers. Eventually he became so famous that he appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show and in movies, performed for the king and queen of England, and opened his own resort in the Catskills. Barasch's watercolor-and-ink cartoon paintings capture the poverty of the dancer's early life, the adulation of his fans, and his joyous love of dancing. Vignettes across a spread depict him performing typical tap steps in his own unique way. A final photograph of Bates in action is complemented by his words: ""Don't look at me in sympathy,/I'm glad that I'm this way./I feel good, knockin' on wood.""

All rights reserved.Gr. 2-3, younger for reading aloud. The name Peg Leg Bates is no longer familiar, but his story is captivating. Born a sharecropper's son, African American Clayton Bates never wanted to do anything but dance, yet he had to bring in money, so at 12, he got a job at a cottonseed factory. Within three days, he had lost his leg in a machine accident. Despite that misfortune, he pursued a successful dancing career. Wearing a wooden leg, he was soon performing for black audiences; eventually he made his way to national venues such as the Ed Sullivan show. Sprightly ink-and-watercolor art ably depicts both the poverty of Bates' early life and the colorful world of entertainment. A remarkable two-page spread bridges the before and after, showing many small images of Bates in various tap dancing positions. Barasch subtly sets the story against American racism; to join a white vaudeville troupe, Bates had to wear blackface, and to eat he had to find a restaurant in the black community. Still, Bates prevailed. Quotes at the book's conclusion offer a taste of his philosophy: ""Black or white, one leg or two, it doesn't matter. Good is good.""

Religions,"Description: Grade 3-6Demi draws on the King James Version of the Holy Bible, as well as apocryphal sources such as The Book of Mary and The Life of Mary: As Seen by the Mystics, to tell her subject's story. By going beyond the traditional Bible, she is able to add details about Mary's childhood and to describe more fully her role in developing the early Church. The art and design of the book is similar to Demi's Mother Teresa and Jesus (both S &amp; S, 2005), featuring paintings filled with bright, intricate patterns and bold touches of gold. The perspective is often flat and the pictorial elements on many pages seem to float in space. As in Jesus, the images are somewhat traditional in their depictions of winged angels and a white-haired God figure above the frame of several illustrations. The people and angels all have Caucasian features and skin tones. Children will need adult guidance to understand the text. Catholic schools in particular will appreciate this reverent perspective on Mary's life.Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christopher's School, Richmond, VA Copyright Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Last year, Demi added Jesus to her list of distinguished books about religious figures. Now, she turns her considerable artistic talents to Jesus' mother, Mary, Queen of Heaven. Demi begins her story before Mary is born, when her parents, Anna and Joachim, learn that their prayers have been heard, and that they will have a child whom they will dedicate to the service of the Lord. Nor does the story end as it traditionally does--at the Crucifixion--instead it follows Mary's ascension into heaven. The information comes from The Book of Mary and Pseudo-Melito among others), both noncanonical sources, which Demi blends with more familiar gospel stories: the annunciation, Jesus' birth, and the wedding at Cana. The more obscure texts are credited, but never really explained, even in a note, and the writing throughout is sophisticated, with only a nod toward the intended audience. Yet, in some ways that barely matters; the words simply serve as a backdrop for the glorious artwork, which seems even more ornate and gilded than in Demi's previous books. Along with her familiar beautiful borders and diminutive characters, she incorporates many Jewish and Christian symbols that tie the religions together. Some of the pictures are almost whimsical, as in one delightful scene in which a garland of angels surrounds Mary. The moment of Jesus' death is moving and stark, with Mary huddled alone at the foot of the cross. Ilene CooperCopyright American Library Association.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: Grade 8 Up&mdash;In this conclusion to the trilogy, Seeker, a Noble Warrior, is using his extraordinary powers to track down and kill the last two remaining savanters, evil creatures that drain the lir (life) out of their victims in order to prolong their own. Seeker has tracked them from the ends of the Earth, and to kill them is his final mission. What starts as a hunt turns into a philosophical debate. Each of the three Noble Warriors is presented with both an external battle of swords and flesh and an internal battle of faith and understanding. The setting for this story is a pastoral world much like our own 150 years ago. There are deserts and mountains, green valleys and deep seas that Seeker spends most of the book running through, which keeps the tempo of the story up. The other main characters seem to sit and contemplate their existence, occasionally moving for a fight or a short trip. Their focus is on the nature of the world, their place in it, and whether their god&mdash;the All and Only&mdash;exists at all. Unfortunately, the theme is sometimes too obviously superimposed on the plot. Relationship patterns and scenes among the characters are recycled over and over again. Wildman and Caressa, for example, have the same argument numerous times, and it's hardly worthy of two military leaders such as themselves. Still, the book is worth purchasing for fans of the series.&mdash;Jennifer-Lynn Draper, Children's Literature Consultant, Oshawa, Ontario, Canada Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Animals,"Description: Kindergarten-Grade 6-A story about the custom of Kapores, told by a man looking back on his childhood in a 19th-century Russian village. As described here, the ritual involves holding a chicken over someone's head while reciting a prayer in order to rid the person of the year's misdeeds. Triggering a commotion in the prayer house, the boy is sent outside and observes the chicken population leaving town. They're fed up with being vehicles for a New Year's clean slate. The boy pleads with the revolutionaries, saying he needs them to make Kapores so that his father will be proud of him. A hen asks, ""Boychick- for this, do you really need a chicken?"" In this skillful adaptation of a story by Sholom Aleichem, Silverman's addition of a young narrator lends immediacy and empathy, and streamlines the story with no loss of flavor and point. Though the tale is accessible and enjoyable, a discussion of Kapores beyond what is offered here will increase children's understanding and appreciation of the story. The comic alliteration and in-your-beak attitude of the cheeky chickens, reinforced by the handsomely humorous paintings, are appealing. Executed in layers of ink, pencil, gouache, acrylic, and oil, the illustrations are a wonderful combination of modern and folk art. The fiercely funny fowl, with long necks, whitish bodies, and rich red coxcombs, squawk right off the page. Good New Year's-let alone Rosh Hashanah-stories are in short supply. This is one to crow about.Nancy Palmer, The Little School, Bellevue, WACopyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.K-Gr. 3. In this Jewish New Year story, based on a Sholom Aleichem tale, a young boy sneaks away from religious services to spy on a meeting of local chickens. The birds are upset about the tradition of Kapores, a custom involving twirling chickens overhead to symbolically rid a person of bad deeds. Declaring freedom for fowl, the birds go on strike, and not even negotiators can convince them to return. Without the ceremony, the boy despairs that he will ever be good enough to please his father; then, one of the hens gently explains to him that humans can control their own behavior. Trueman's stylistically inventive mixed-media illustrations, rich in earth tones, are visually striking. They juxtapose well with Silverman's understated yet humorous text; both include many nineteenth-century Russian setting details. A perfect choice for holiday read-alouds, this will make a welcome addition to religious collections, especially in libraries where there is a Jewish audience.

History,"Description: Gr 35The Statue of Freedom, which sits high atop the dome of the U.S. Capitol, would not be the symbol it is today without the ingenuity of an enslaved African American laborer. Philip Reid was owned by the renowned sculptor Clark Mills and by 1859 was an experienced foundry worker. When Mills was commissioned to cast Freedom in bronze, the two men retrieved the plaster model, only to be met with a conundrum. A room full of craftsmen and engineers were puzzled as to how to dismantle the plaster model for transport without cracking it, thereby making it useless and impossible to cast. Mills offered the expertise of Reid, who, through the use of a tackle and pulley, solved the problem that left so many others perplexed. He not only earned their respect but made a lasting contribution to the heritage of our nation. Commendable in its acknowledgment of the enslaved work force to which we owe much of the nation's capital, the book nonetheless leaves readers with as many questions as answers. Primary sources are reproduced in the back matter, but they offer little insight into actual events. While directly stating that much remains unknown about Reid's childhood, the authors still fabricate parts of the story, providing speculative assumptions on the thoughts and feelings of the individuals involved with no supportive evidence. Yet the story remains a testament to how one man's experience and expertise in his trade can overcome social prejudice and injustice while earning the respect of peers. Christie's striking, evocative illustrations enhance the text. For collections needing materials on themes presented herein, this is a suitable purchase, albeit secondary.Rebecca Gueorguiev, New York Public LibraryOn December 2, 1863, a bronze statue called Freedom was placed atop the dome of the recently completed U.S. Capitol Building. But how was it constructed? To answer this question, we must first begin on a Charleston, South Carolina, farm, where a 10-year-old slave named Philip Reid works with a blacksmith and a potter, pumping bellows and stoking the kiln. When a craftsman named Clark Mills arrives to create a plaster molding on the walls and ceilings of Reids masters home, Reid helps by holding the ladder steady; at the end of the project, Mills buys Philip for $1,500 and makes him his assistant in his Washington, D.C., foundry casting objects in bronze. The government then hires Mills to cast the Freedom statue, but when they arrive at the Capitol to obtain the plaster model, theres a problem: nobody can detect the plasters seams and, therefore, cant dismantle the gigantic statue to move it. But Reid finds a way. This book about a little-known historical figure and event includes fascinating endpapers, which are Reids purchase papers, and an epilogue featuring Reids pay stub from the foundry ($1.25 per day). Christies rich acrylic gouache illustrations evocatively convey Reids life as a slave and his work in the foundry. An important piece of history for kids to know.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: Gr 13Nine-year-old Gabe has been selected for the best hockey team in town, and she is its youngest member. She wore her lucky number 22 jersey for tryouts, in honor of her hero, Hayley Wickenheiser, a Canadian Olympic star. Unfortunately, when the coach passes out the new jerseys, Gabe gets number nine, and she refuses to be on the team. Grandma Gabriella comes to the rescue later that night, telling her granddaughter how it was when she was young and played hockey. They didn't even allow girls on the teamshe had to pretend she was a boy until she was caught. Back in her day, everyone, including Grandma, sported number nine because that's what the famous players wore. Gabe, of course, has a change of heart . The story may have the most meaning to children in Canada, but it could appeal to young hockey fanatics no matter where they live. Despres's gouache illustrations are light and simple. The warmth between the grandmother and granddaughter as well as Gabe's initial disappointment are shown clearly in their amusing expressions. Recommended as a secondary purchase.Diane McCabe, John Muir Elementary, Santa Monica, CA*Starred Review* Nine-year-old Gabe, chosen for the best hockey team in town, is desperate to wear number 22 on her jersey, just like her idol, Hayley Wickenheiser. After receiving number 9, she buries the jersey in her closet and sulks. That evening, Gabes no-nonsense grandma shows her an old black-and-white hockey-team photo of 11 boys and herself, disguised as a boy because girls were not allowed to play. Soon discovered and thrown off the team, she wore (as a fan) a number 9 jersey, like Maurice Rocket Richard or Gordie Howe. Grandma lists other outstanding players who wore the number, ending with Wayne Gretzky, who couldnt get 9, so he chose 99. The storys ending, in which Gabe dreams of her number 9 retired and raised to the rafters, is uplifting in every way. MacGregors writing packs an emotional punch without relying on sentimentality (when the coach hands her the disappointing jersey, Gabes heart felt as if a skate had just run across it). Expressive pencil drawings brightened with color washes perfectly capture the characters feelings. From the moment Grandma begins to share her past and her passion for hockey, the storys context becomes broader, more complex, and more meaningful. A memorable, intergenerational picture book thats perfect for sharing. Grades 1-3. --Carolyn Phelan; Title: The Highest Number in the World",2,70405,"[41710, 73298]"

The boy, Jack, who ""look[s] up to the little skyscraper,"" stands on a corner with his parents as vintage cars drive by and The Fountainhead plays at the cinema across the street. Later, he grows up to fight City Hall on the building's behalf. Despite the simplistic, old-fashioned text, Santoro (Isaac the Ice Cream Truck) draws on his experience as an animator to create a breezy, cinematic perspective and a heightened sense of space (though the book's overlong vertical format may present shelving challenges). He captures both the exhilarating bustle and growth of a metropolis, as well as the sense of menace that the ever-encroaching urban canyon represents to the beleaguered building. The artist makes the most of the little skyscraper's two cathedral-window eyes and mouth to communicate emotions, from joy to chagrin as well as an attack of vertigo (""Sometimes even the little skyscraper got dizzy from looking down""). Even youngest readers will get the heavy-handed message that when something wonderful from the past is preserved, everybody stands tall. All ages.

Jack, now an architect, leads the battle to have the Little Skyscraper declared a landmark and restored to its former glory. Santoro has worked for Disney, and the cheerful pastel colors and smiling buildings evoke memories of vintage cartoons.

Animals,"Description: *Starred Review* PreS-Gr. 2. Many children know pill bugs as roly-polies and think of them as insects. In this picture book, a pill bug narrates a fascinating account of life among his humble yet admirable fellow crustaceans. In an easy-to-follow, conversational style, he explains what pill bugs eat and excrete, why they live near people, how they protect themselves against predators, why they shed and then eat their shells (""Yum! Very nutritious""), how they reproduce, and more. The final pages describe how to find pill bugs, touch them, and even keep one indoors as a guest before putting it back, since ""He'll want to be with his family during the cold winter!"" The lucid, matter-of-fact text answers the main questions children may have about the critters as well as some they might not have thought to ask.

After Elisabet Holder's widower father, the wealthy London-born captain of a merchant ship, is captured by the British, the 11-year-old travels from their home in Boston to New Orleans to live with her aunt and uncle. Once there, Elisabet learns that the family has fallen on hard times and she is expected to work in the couple's bakery.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: Gr 35Wren Jo Byrd navigates the beginning of her fourth grade year and her parents' separation with mixed success. Bowe creates realistic tension with Wren's secretiveness and dishonesty toward her best friend, Amber; a new girl in town named Marianna; and shifting family dynamics. Wren learns that Marianna has secrets of her own, and as both characters' secrets are exposed, the girls and their relationship mature. The final resolution provides Wren (and readers) with the assurance that her parents love her and that life will go on. Bowe integrates the themes of divorce and friendship well and with an awareness of her audience. She gently conveys the intricacies and hardships of balancing time with both parents, routines and family mementos changing, and the experience of being rejected by a friend. The characters, while relatable, are relatively flat, making it hard to fully engage with them. VERDICT Bowe writes Wren's story with sensitivity, yet with the wealth of literature on divorce and friendship (Kevin Henkes's Bird Lake Moon, Kate DiCamillo's Flora and Ulysses, Nikki Grimes's Words with Wings), this is an additional purchase.Hilary Writt, Sullivan University, Lexington, KY""Big &amp; Little Questions is by turns heartbreaking and heartwarmingexactly like real life.

Wren's decision to hide her difficulties at home, even as it affects her life on many fronts, powerfully illustrates how deeply upsetting family changes can be. Bowe's genuine portraits of the key relationships in Wren's lifewith her friends, parents, and even the often-difficult Mariannamake for a warm and rewarding story about dealing with change.""PW, starred review""Bowe's first-person voice for Wren is quietly contemplative, frustrated, and confused by the disruption in her family but also determined to sort out how things will work. It's a realistic young voice nicely free from snarky irony, and it's focused on the arts of questioning and paying attention to the answers.""Kirkus""Bowe gets most everything right here: the pain and often embarrassment that comes with divorce, the agony over losing an old friend, and the way secrets . . . have ways of slipping out.""BooklistPraise for the Friends for Keeps series:""Preteens will gobble up this girl-friendly depiction of the world of early middle school and its ensuing changes.""Kirkus (My Extra Best Friend)""[T]his engaging presentation portrays the crossroads friends face as they navigate school popularity, classroom crushes, and the various problems on the path to maturity.""School Library Journal (My Forever Friends)""Like Jeff Kinney's Diary of a Wimpy Kid, My Best Frenemy emphasizes the conflict between wanting to do the right thing and wanting to earn popularity.""School Library Journal (My Best Frenemy)""Bowe is spot-on with Ida May's feelings. . . .

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: Grade 1-4-- A boy and his father have come to the Vietnam War Memorial to look for the boy's grandfather's name among those who were killed in the war. They find his name surrounded, but far from lost, in the rows of print that ""march side by side, like rows of soldiers."" ""I'm proud that your grandfather's name is on this wall,"" says the boy's father. The boy agrees, adding, ""but I'd rather have my grandpa here."" Before this powerful book is half finished, readers will be deeply moved. Bunting's understated prose captures the meaning of the memorial to the American people, especially to those who lost loved ones, without being maudlin or heavy-handed. Himler's gauzy watercolors are a perfect accompaniment: impressionistic enough for the characters to appear as everymen.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: PreSchool-Grade 3This lively romp across India introduces children to aspects of the country's culture and geography. A little girl named Shoba and Fuzzy Patel (her stuffed monkey) fly on their bed to India in the middle of the night to attend Fuzzy's cousin's wedding. They land in the desert and meet a camel, a coconut juice seller, a line of elephants, a group of monks, and a snake charmer, all of whom guide them to Mumbai (Bombay). Fuzzy, described as ""a bit of a snob,"" does not want to invite any of their new friends to the wedding. When Shoba and Fuzzy arrive at the celebration, however, they discover that all of the invitees are unable to attend, but readers can see that the people and animals have followed the pair all along, and soon they're welcomed as guests. Colorful gouache illustrations with folk-art details lend an authentic feel to the story, and their slightly stylized appearance highlights the imaginary aspects of the tale.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: Set in 1947, Teammates concerns a little-known episode about Brooklyn Dodgers' second baseman Jackie Robinson and the integration of baseball. When Dodgers shortstop Pee Wee Reese, incensed by the abuse coming from a Cincinnati crowd, determined to ""take a stand,"" he put an arm around his teammate's shoulder; this simple gesture symbolized the end of the ""color line"" in major league baseball--and the beginning of a great friendship. The book's appropriately ironic beginning talks of a time ""when automobiles were black and looked like tanks and laundry was white and hung on clotheslines to dry."" Golenbock then introduces the Negro Leagues, enumerates the many differences between them and the Major Leagues, and credits Dodger general manager Branch Rickey with finding ""one special man"" who would exemplify great ballplaying and thereby eradicate the prejudices of the fans. Golenbock's bold and lucid style distills this difficult issue, and brings a dramatic tale vividly to life. Bacon's spare, nostalgic watercolors, in addition to providing fond glimpses of baseball lore, present a haunting portrait of one man's isolation. Historic photographs of the major characters add interest and a touch of stark reality to an unusual story, beautifully rendered. Ages 6-9. Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Kindergarten-Grade 6-- Golenbock has taken a single moment of baseball history, set it in its social context, and created a simple and moving tribute to courage and brotherhood. While other biographies of Robinson, and Robinson himself in I Never Had It Made (Putnam, 1972; o.p.), set the incident in Boston, Golenbock places it in Cincinnati, near Reese's Kentucky home. The event occurred during Jackie Robinson's first season with the Dodgers. Listening to the hatred that spilled out of the stands, Pee Wee Reese left his position at shortstop, walked over to Robinson at first base, put his around Robinson's shoulder, chatted for a few moments, and then returned to his position. The crowd was stunned into silence. Bacon has illustrated the book with an effective blend of photographs and drawings. Golenbock briefly but clearly describes the background of Robinson's entry into the National League, as well as Reese's background as a southerner and as the player with the most to fear if Robinson were successful--both men were shortstops (although Robinson would ultimately play second base). There have been several recent books about Robinson for young readers, such as David Adler's Jackie Robinson: He Was the First (Holiday, 1989) and Jim O'Connor's Jackie Robinson and the Story of All-Black Baseball (Random, 1989), but none of them have the style or dramatic impact of Golenbock and Bacon's work. This is a wonderful and important story, beautifully presented, but the geographic confusion is disturbing. --Elaine Fort Weischedel, Turner Free Library, Randolph, MACopyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.; Title: Teammates",2,7024,"[397, 4383, 5384, 6200, 6680, 6809, 6915, 7111, 7140, 7174, 7194, 7237, 7317, 7479, 9581, 9615, 10053, 10055, 10445, 13390, 14058, 15393, 15399, 15414, 15598, 15600, 15650, 16061, 16062, 16344, 16542, 17050, 17432, 17700, 18695, 18880, 18978, 19362, 23377, 23829, 24879, 25015, 25152, 27246, 27265, 27752, 28065, 28125, 34851, 34991, 35884, 36585, 38071, 38306, 39127, 39338, 43127, 45948, 46919, 48591, 48676, 54771, 60364, 60411, 61229, 62709, 63501]"

Moshe Cotel, a young composer, lives alone in a busy, noisy city, but ""Everything he heard was music to his ears."" One day he discovers Ketzel, a tiny, black-and-white kitten, on the street. He holds her tenderly to his chest and declares, ""I will take you home, and we will make beautiful music together,"" prophetic words, to say the least. When Moshe receives a letter from the Paris New Music Review about a contest to write a composition of 60 seconds or less, try as he might, he is at a loss. Then, Ketzel creeps across the keyboard, inadvertently accomplishing what the composer could not. ""Moshe grabbed a pencil and jotted down exactly what he'd heard. 'Your composition has a clear beginning, middle, and end, is full of heart, and takes exactly 21 seconds to play. Ketzel, you're a genius!'""

Literature & Fiction,"Description: Gr 46In 1943, the summer before she begins fifth grade, Susan Marcus's family moves from New York City to St. Louis. At first, the avid Yankee fan is apprehensive about relocating to Cardinals country and being able to understand the accents of her new neighbors. She is also surprised to find that in Missouri her family won't need to put up blackout curtains or volunteer for the air-raid watch. Susan encounters prejudice toward Jews, Japanese, African Americans, and even New Yorkers for the first time. Disgusted with Jim Crow laws that keep her from being able to go to the swimming pool or movie theater with her African American friend Loretta, Susan cooks up a plan to push the limits of the laws. The novel splendidly captures the place and time, from the heat and humidity (and lack of air conditioning), to childhood pastimes like roller skating, playing jacks, and drinking Kool Aid. Facts about the era are smoothly integrated into the story. However, due to the lengthy descriptions, the plot is slow to get moving, and most of the action takes place in the latter half of the novel. Although the author uses the terminology of the time to describe race (Japanese are referred to as Japs, Africans Americans as colored), the story is a gentler read than Mildred Taylor's Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry (Dial, 1976). Children will cheer for Susan's courage in defying the injustice in her world.Jackie Partch, Multnomah County Library, Portland, ORWhen Susans father loses his job during WWII, she and her parents move from the Bronx to Clayton, Missouri. Leaving her best pal, Marv, and their favorite team, the Yankees, and finding herself in Cardinals territory is hard. Still, Susan quickly befriends Marlene and also Loretta, a Negro kid who informs Susan that she talks funny. That summer, while Susan works on her Missouri accent, she also finds a way to rebel against Jim Crow rules. As events unfold, she observes prejudice against Jews and Asians as well as African Americans. Its unusual to find a chapter book for younger readers that takes on the painful history of racial segregation and discrimination. By using Susan as the narrator, Cutler lets readers see life under Jim Crow through multiple perspectives: Susan sees basic injustice, while Loretta understands the situation more fully. Rebelling against discrimination is only part of this appealing story, but its the most memorable part. An enjoyable chapter book with great potential for discussion.

"Arts, Music & Photography","Description: Gr 5-8Ohr was a homegrown genius and the greatest artist potter on Earth, or so he claimed, and while dismissed by many as a self-promoting eccentric (he was that), much of what he declared about himself is recognized as true today. His pottery, notably inventive in its shapes, textures, and glazes, became more experimental and free-flowing in form after 1894, when fire destroyed his kiln. While clearly distinct, Ohr's art was not outsider; he subscribed to the ideals of the Arts and Crafts movement, and for a short time worked with Joseph Meyer furnishing pottery for the women of The Ladies' Decorative Arts League in New Orleans. But Ohr was quirky, flamboyant, and a Biloxi, Mississippi, tourist attraction; he had a bushy handlebar mustache that he could wrap around his ears, and he was often difficult. The authors do an excellent job describing this larger-than-life character through quotes and plentiful color photos of his pottery, or mud babies as he referred to his creations. Of particular interest are the archival sepia photos, including the two large, double-page images depicting the artist in his barnlike studio with piles and piles of his workand several childrenabout, that open and close the book. A one-page guide on How to Look at a Pot examines a decorative piece with reference to texture, color, form, line, and expression. Extensive source notes round out this nicely designed, fascinating introduction to the master craftsman and art pottery.Daryl Grabarek, School Library Journal(c) Copyright 2013. Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc. No redistribution permitted.*Starred Review* Chances are you have never heard of George Ohr (18571918) of Biloxi, Mississippi. An eccentric who called himself The Mad Potter, he created wheel-thrown pots that he pinched and bent, curved and rippled, wrinkled and dimpled into distinctive shapes before adding original glazes. When those pots didnt sell, he continued to make them, while supporting his family by producing useful wares and amusing knickknacks. Ohrs flamboyant personality and preposterous advertising drew tourists to his studio but earned him disdain in the art community. Still, he believed that future generations would recognize his genius. And oddly enough, they did. Rediscovered in the 1970s, his highly praised art pottery is now displayed in museums, including one designed by Frank Gehry and dedicated to Ohrs work. The artist comes to life in this clearly written narrative, full of well-chosen details and anecdotes. Fine vintage photos show Ohr at work and with his family. Viewers accustomed to the usually staid photographs from the period will be amused by pictures in which Ohrs tomfoolery and bravado are as evident as his wild mustache. Throughout the book, color photos of his art pottery remind readers that Ohrs story is worth telling not just because its entertaining, but because his pots are unique and beautiful. This informative introduction to the artist who made them closes with exemplary back matter that will help readers of all ages approach art with enthusiasm and confidence.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: Mrs. Jolly Bones lives with a menageriea pig, cow, chicken, bunnyand she has an utterly unique take on housekeeping. Monday is laundry day, and the task starts out in the usual way: she gathers the dirty clothes and then washes, dries, and irons them. And then the fun beginsone by one, each freshly laundered item is tossed gaily out the window, where they brighten up the street! Wednesday, cleaning day, is no less kooky, as Mrs. Jolly Bones sweeps and scrubs, before strapping on a snorkel and cleaning herself up (bubbles and all) in the toilet bowl. Hansons supersilly story provides great material for an illustrator, and Tusa capitalizes on every opportunity with her joyful, signature watercolor-and-pen loose line drawings, depicting a flighty housekeeper and her bevy of animals who wear pops of muted color in the form of pearls and kerchiefs. This color palette continues throughout to lovely effect, particularly on busy spreads with black-and-white backgrounds and pastel-colored details. Most kids hate chores, so theyll appreciate the housekeeping skills on display here. Preschool-Grade 2. --Ann KelleyThe small things add so much delight: Mrs. Jolly Bones has a menagerie of animals that surround/help her. Amelia Bedelia may come to mind, but Mrs. Jolly Bones unconventional behavior reflects her originality and flair rather than a lack of intelligence; would that more people flaunt their individualitybut maybe not in the toilet. (Kirkus Reviews, February 1, 2013)Its evident from Mrs. Jolly Boness billowing apron, unruly hair, and comfy slippers that she is not a conventional housekeeper. In fact, her views on domestic engineering are rather innovative. Tusa (A Meal of the Stars) draws her with cheerful, quirky lines and gives the drawings touches of soft watercolor. Hansons (The Sea of Sleep) catchy verse depends on a predictable setup and a subversive punch line. Mrs. Jolly Boness life is one of cheerful but determined rule breaking, and readers are guaranteed to laugh out loud at each gag.

It also might make an association with the days of the week that will help children remember them. Ink and watercolor illustrations add lots of details and humor. This charming picture book is great for a read-aloud about being silly and imaginative. What an engaging way to reinforce learning the days of the week.

Hansons cheeky rhyming text expertly delivers each days punch line, and Tusas joyful watercolor and ink illustrations help set the pace and bring the storys infectious silliness to a whole new level. Mrs. Jolly Bones lives up to her name; her irreverent approach to chores is one kids will enthusiastically endorse (up for debate, perhaps: step into the toilet bowl and give yourself a scrub). (The Horn Book, March/April 2013)In this rollicking ballad, Mrs. Jolly Bones is a woman who keeps a serious housekeeping schedulein her own peculiar way.

In a fit of impishness, the preschooler tosses him into the air and he lands on top of a school bus just as it is pulling away from the curb. Lily fears that he'll be thrown off and lost, but he makes it to school, landing safely in a bush when the bus stops. The soft toy is discovered at recess by a student and spends the rest of the day inside on a classroom Interest Shelf, observing the children at their studies. Lily's mother finally tracks him down, and he is reunited with a relieved, grateful Lily. It's a simple story, written cleanly and clearly. Surrounded by ample white space, the artwork is big, bright, and cheery, although some of the faces of the human characters are sketchily rendered. The best illustrations are those of Bobbo. His static expression seems to be one of unruffled amusement at his state of affairs, and it's definitely worth a laugh.-Alyson Low, Fayetteville Public Library, AR(c) Copyright 2011.

Lily sobs and Mom calls the school for help, but Bobbo enjoys his adventure. Found in a bush at recess, he visits a classroom until Lily and Mom arrive to take him home. Hughes picture books are notable for their sensitive, realistic portrayals of young children and their families.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: Phil Rink wanted a water ski when he was fifteen years old, so he bought a mahogany plank and built one. Later, at his first engineering job, dissatisfied with the performance of a water treatment cell, Phil built several prototypes in his garage. His innovations were patented and eventually became the basis for an entire water sanitation industry. Phil's ability to build, as well as think, led to a successful problem solving career and eleven patents, so far. When he and his family couldn't find accessible but substantial books about inventing and science for kids, and especially boys, Phil decided to write his own. The plot of the first book, ""Jimi & Isaac 3a: The Mars Mission,"" came together during a cross-country drive from Florida to Washington State. Completing the book took the next eight years. Phil learned to apply mythic structure to modern settings and to place the story in a specific setting without drowning it in dry details or trite conventions. Over time, Phil has become more convinced of the need for relevant, updated stories to help boys find their place in the world. Classic myth and modern fantasy are useful to discuss values, but they don't clearly relate to the practical issues of growing up in a quickly changing world where boys may not follow their father's career, play their father's sport, or readily apply their father's life lessons (if they even have a father or father figure).

Use your good sense. Kids up on their chiropteran knowledge will see where this is going: Chiro floats through intimidating black washes until he begins to sing, a ray of light emanating from his mouth that illuminates the path ahead as he flies past the woods, through a flock of geese, and to the pond, where he gobbles contentedly on tasty bugs. Paralleling good sense with both a song to light a path and with a bats echolocation might require kids to flex their conceptualization muscles a bit, but Longs gorgeous artwork, in which the warmly hued bat flits through steep, rich darkness, goes a long way toward making this one a winner.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: James Riley lives in Virginia. He is the author of&nbsp;Half Upon a Time,&nbsp;Twice Upon a Time, and&nbsp;Once Upon the End&nbsp;as well as the Story Thieves series.Secret Origins CHAPTER 1 The evil King of All Stories held his enormous eraser to Bethany&#8217;s head as she tried to escape. &#8220;It&#8217;s too late, heroes!&#8221; the king told Owen, Kiel, and Charm. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing you can do! Now I&#8217;ll erase the parts of Bethany&#8217;s life story that make her a good person, thereby turning her into my evil minion. Then, together, we&#8217;ll invade the nonfictional world and rule everything!&#8221; &#8220;Let her go!&#8221; Owen shouted. &#8220;Or you won&#8217;t like what comes next.&#8221; The evil King of All Stories sneered. &#8220;You? The nonfictional hero who&#8217;s saved the fictional world more times than I can count? You have no power here, boy.&#8221; &#8220;Don&#8217;t I?&#8221; Owen took out paper and a pencil and began writing. The King of All Stories drops his eraser. The king&#8217;s eraser immediately dropped out of his hand. &#8220;What?&#8221; the king shouted in amazement. &#8220;But how?&#8221; &#8220;Through the power of words!&#8221; Owen shouted. &#8220;Books are magical, and so is writing!&#8221; He wrote something else on the paper. The King of All Stories lets Bethany go, then trips on his own feet. The king let go of Bethany, then spectacularly wiped out on his next step, doing a front flip before landing hard on his back. The Crown of Stories fell off his head and rolled a few feet away. The Crown of Stories appears on Owen&#8217;s head, Owen wrote. Immediately, the crown disappeared from the ground, then reappeared on Owen&#8217;s head. It was exactly the right size, as if it were made for him all along. &#8220;No!&#8221; the former king shouted from the ground. &#8220;You can&#8217;t do this to me. This is all I had!&#8221; &#8220;Not true,&#8221; Owen said, turning to his former archenemy. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t you, Your Majesty. You&#8217;re not meant to be evil. Someone&#8217;s rewritten your story, just as you tried to do for Bethany.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m not?&#8221; the former king said. &#8220;Then what was I meant to be?&#8221; &#8220;A father,&#8221; Owen said quietly, then wrote something on his paper. The former King of All Stories turns back into his real self. Instantly a bright light filled the room, then spread out over the entire Kingdom of Stories, blinding anyone who happened to be looking at the castle at that moment. The light enveloped the former king, raising him into the air in a completely awesome way. The light became too bright to look at, and they all covered their eyes except Owen, who wrote himself sunglasses that made him look even cooler. Then abruptly, the light disappeared and everything went dark. &#8220;Looks like this story,&#8221; Owen said, pulling off his sunglasses, &#8220;just started a new chapter.&#8221; Bethany slowly stepped past Owen, her eyes on the figure on the ground. The former king was no longer dressed in royal robes. Now he wore normal clothes, and his hair had turned the same shade as Bethany&#8217;s, a bronzish red. The man shook his head, then slowly pushed to his feet, his mouth hanging open. &#8220;. . . Bethany?&#8221; he said, his eyes widening. &#8220;Dad?&#8221; she said, not believing it. &#8220;It&#8217;s me, Beth,&#8221; her dad said, holding out his arms. &#8220;You&#8217;ve saved me! I never thought I&#8217;d be able to turn back to my true self, but you&#8217;ve done it!&#8221; Bethany ran forward and jumped into her dad&#8217;s arms, knocking them both to the ground. &#8220;Dad!&#8221; she shouted. &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s you! Owen, you did it!&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen anything so sweet,&#8221; Kiel said from Owen&#8217;s side, rubbing his eyes. &#8220;I have,&#8221; Charm said, looking at Owen as her hand slipped into his. &#160;&#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; The white paw of a black cat touched Owen&#8217;s hand, and he stopped writing. Spike, Owen&#8217;s fictional self&#8217;s former cat, glanced up at Owen from his desk with a look that said, Really? &#8220;Too much?&#8221; Owen asked his fictional cat. Spike just blinked his eyes slowly, leaving his paw on Owen&#8217;s hand. &#8220;I have,&#8221; Charm said, looking at Owen with affection. Spike dug his claws into Owen&#8217;s hand, and Owen sighed. &#8220;Fine.&#8221; &#8220;Really?&#8221; Charm said, stepping away from the other two. &#8220;No one else thinks this is a trap? I&#8217;m the only one?&#8221; Spike took his paw off of Owen&#8217;s hand and began to purr contentedly as he closed his eyes to nap again. &#8220;You know, I&#8217;m the one who&#8217;s writing this,&#8221; Owen said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s not exactly easy. Maybe at least hold your judgment until it&#8217;s done?&#8221; Spike briefly opened his eyes, then closed them again, completely unmoved. Owen absently scratched his cat&#8217;s stomach, reading over what he had written. Ugh. Why was it all so bad? Did every writer have this problem? Everything just seemed so . . . obvious. Make the villain Bethany&#8217;s dad? It&#8217;d been done a thousand times. He began to idly tap the keys without pressing them while he stared off into space. When he glanced back at the computer, though, there were new words. Apparently he&#8217;d been typing without realizing it? &#8220;Owen,&#8221; said a man who appeared out of nowhere, with no features or details anywhere on his body. The mannequin-looking man had his back to the Owen in the story as he spoke to the real Owen. &#8220;Stop this at once. You&#8217;re manipulating fictional characters&#8217; lives. Do you have any idea what you&#8217;re doing here?&#8221; Owen&#8217;s eyes widened as he read the lines, while at his side, Spike began to growl, low and menacing. Owen hadn&#8217;t just written those words . . . had he? And then more text appeared on the screen, without Owen even moving his hands. &#8220;Do not write again,&#8221; Nobody said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to have to tell you this twice.&#8221; And with that, he disappeared. A chill went through Owen, and he quickly reread the last few lines. What had just happened? Was that really Nobody? And if so, was Owen actually messing with real fictional people&#8217;s lives? Had he just created another fictional Owen? He quickly highlighted the entire story, ready to hit the delete button, then froze. What if he had created new people, and was now going to delete them? Would that take them out of existence somehow? His finger hovered over the button as he looked to Spike for an answer. But now that Nobody was gone, the cat seemed to have returned to his nap, not paying any attention. Should he delete the story, or was that worse? If only there was someone he could ask&#8212; &#8220;OWEN!&#8221; shouted someone from mere inches away. Owen screamed and tumbled out of his chair, while Spike tore away across the room, hiding under the bed. His heart racing, Owen turned to find Bethany&#8217;s head sticking out of a piece of paper on his desk, and he gave her the dirtiest look he could. &#8220;Don&#8217;t do that! You scared me half to death!&#8221; She&#8217;d given him a page from a book she kept hidden under her bed. In case of emergencies (fictional characters escaping their books, libraries burning down, that kind of thing) she could jump in one page, move to the next part of the story, then pop out of his. But it was not meant for terrifying him! &#8220;Good, you should be scared!&#8221; she said, breathing heavily. &#8220;Because that guy is back on the street again, the one who keeps watching my house!&#8221; Owen groaned loudly. &#8220;Seriously? This again?&#8221; &#8220;Oh, is my being stalked by a crazy person boring to you?&#8221; Bethany asked, giving him a sarcastic look. &#8220;Get over here and help me spy on him!&#8221; She moved her head to the side, and one hand popped out of the page. Owen shook his head. &#8220;No way. Remember what happened last time I came over to check on this guy?&#8221; Bethany rolled her eyes. &#8220;He wasn&#8217;t there, but only because he must have seen us coming!&#8221; &#8220;And the time before that?&#8221; &#8220;That one, I got the car wrong.&#8221; &#8220;And we terrified that poor old lady!&#8221; &#8220;Then she shouldn&#8217;t be acting so suspiciously!&#8221; Bethany yelled, her hand flying around wildly. &#8220;Who sits in their car for ten minutes at eleven at night?&#8221; &#8220;She couldn&#8217;t get it started!&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s what she wanted us to think,&#8221; Bethany said, glancing around suspiciously. &#8220;Hurry up, or he might leave again!&#8221; &#8220;Which would mean he&#8217;s not actually spying on you,&#8221; Owen said, sighing. &#8220;Bethany, it&#8217;s been a while since we jumped into a book&#8212;&#8221; &#8220;Two months, three weeks, and four days, actually. Now come on&#8212;&#8221; &#8220;And I know it&#8217;s been hard on you. But you&#8217;re kind of acting . . . different now.&#8221; Bethany&#8217;s face froze, and she pulled her hand back into the page. &#8220;What? What are you talking about? Don&#8217;t you get it? This could be Doyle, or Fowen again. Maybe Fowen got out of the book where I left him and is back for revenge. Or maybe Doyle remembered everything that happened and wants to figure out how I jump into books. If Kiel were here instead of running off to find out who he is without magic, he could just cast a spell or something to find out who this guy is. But without him, we&#8217;re going to need a good plan.&#8221; Owen groaned again. &#8220;No more mysteries. Please? Fowen and Doyle are both still in the fictional world where we left them. And whoever&#8217;s parked outside your house is probably one of your neighbors, which would explain why he&#8217;s on your street.&#8221; &#8220;You think I&#8217;m making this up, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; Bethany said, looking suspicious. &#8220;Not . . . entirely. I just think you used to jump into books every night, and now, well, your imagination doesn&#8217;t have as much to play with, so it&#8217;s messing with you.&#8221; She gave him an evil look and started to say something, then stopped, shaking her head. &#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re right. I might have a little bit of cabin fever or something. I&#8217;ll just go to bed and forget all this. See you tomorrow?&#8221; &#8220;Yeah, of course,&#8221; Owen said, breathing a sigh of relief. He&#8217;d been worried about saying something for weeks now, but she&#8217;d been getting more and more frantic to find something exciting in their fairly boring lives, and it was out of control. &#8220;And Bethany? Only use that page for emergencies. I might not have clothes on or something!&#8221; Bethany rolled her eyes, then waved good-bye and disappeared. Owen slowly got back into his chair, and Spike came trotting out from under the bed, then jumped into his lap. He petted his cat for a moment, then sighed. &#8220;Bethany&#8217;s going after the guy in the car, isn&#8217;t she.&#8221; Spike just purred in response. &#8220;Fine,&#8221; Owen said, and set Spike on his bed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go, but this guy better be a murderer or something, or I&#8217;m going to be really annoyed!&#8221;; Title: Secret Origins (Story Thieves)",2,55146,"[3738, 3796, 6503, 10829, 11035, 11246, 11372, 11401, 11408, 14055, 16906, 22125, 22883, 48711, 51435, 51558, 51565, 51922, 51953, 51957, 51983, 52044, 54569, 54617, 54791, 55072, 55174, 55371, 55462, 56449, 57422, 57986, 58164, 68460, 74934, 74935, 74937]"

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: Gifted at breathing life into a remote past, Caldecott Medalist McCully (Mirette on the High Wire) once again reaches into the grab bag of history-and unabashedly embroidered legend-emerging with this swashbuckling tale of Grania O'Malley, Ireland's famed lady pirate. Her larger-than-life career is chronicled here from birth in 1530 (her mother reputedly noted that the babe had ""the light of the sea in her eyes"") and early days sailing and marauding with her father, through marriage and childbirth (on the high seas of course), building and losing an empire (half a dozen castles), imprisonment and, finally, meeting her worthy contemporary, Elizabeth I of England, to whom she pleaded her case and won her bold gamble to return to the high seas. McCully writes with great flair, and her sweeping watercolors capitalize on the historical drama. Whether depicting the misty Irish seas or an exciting shipboard melee, her artwork bestows on Grania's life the big-screen effect it deserves. What a woman, what a tale. Hollywood, are you listening? Ages 4-8. Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Grade 2-5?This story of Irish swashbuckler Grania O'Malley is culled from both legend and history (an author's note provides clarification). McCully introduces a 16th-century heroine who will intrigue youngsters and who will offer educators an alternative to what is traditionally presented as a male ""occupation."" Grania's unique mixture of brains and brawn was revealed at an early age through her fluent Latin, her ability to outdance and outgamble any of the sailors, and through a courageous act that saved her father's life. Nothing deterred her. A day after her son was born at sea, Grania ""exchanged the babe for a blunderbuss...and burst onto the deck"" in the midst of a Turkish raid. At the pinnacle of her success, the fearless marauder met her match in an English governor, hired to subdue the Irish. The climax poses the pirate queen in a face-off with Queen Elizabeth I. Windswept hair, leaping figures, blurred outlines, and a liberal use of white highlights pack the paintings with motion and energy that propel the adventures. It is interesting to note that the title appears in the same year as Jane Yolen's The Ballad of the Pirate Queens (Harcourt, 1995). While the two books differ in specific subject, in literary form, and in artistic style, they certainly invite comparison and pairing.

Animals,"Description: PreS-Gr 1-Wondering when their youngster will become a ""real"" wolf, Sweet Little Wolf's furry parents send her to fetch dinner. As Red Riding Hood reads aloud while skipping through the woods to Grandma's house, Sweet Little Wolf scampers behind her. She loves pretty things, the color pink, and stories. Arriving at Grandma's house, she dresses in the old woman's pink robe and cap and climbs into bed. When Red Riding Hood checks on an odd-sounding grandmother, she is frightened by the young wolf and runs out, returning with a woodcutter. The two find Sweet Little Wolf sobbing, ""I want to listen to fairy tales."" In a further twist, Mortimer's compassionate Red Riding Hood writes a letter to the little wolf's parents explaining that their daughter doesn't want to eat girls and dreams of ""being a good, kind wolf."" In the saccharine ending, Mrs. Wolf tells Sweet Little Wolf that her parents love her just the way she is. The playful illustrations add much to the simplistic narrative. Pichon fills Grandma's house with dainty, homey furnishings. In an amusing scene, Sweet Little Wolf sits at the grandmother's dressing table spritzing herself with perfume.

Literature & Fiction,"Description: Gr 4-6-In the newest addition to this series, Erdrich continues her excellent storytelling relating more adventures of a small clan of Ojibwe in the 1860s. Eight-year-old Makoons, or Little Bear, recovers from his heartsick-induced illness (as described in Chickadee [HarperCollins, 2012]) and dreams a vision full of joy and sorrow. Makoons and his twin, Chickadee, travel with their family from western Minnesota to the Dakota Territory in search of ""the generous ones""-buffalo. The two boys are full of mischief, inseparable as they hunt, explore, and grow. They are also a great help to their family as they call the buffalo when the adults begin to despair at having a successful hunt. Information about hunting, packing, foraging, and preparing food is incredibly detailed, but in no way tedious. The family work together tirelessly, knowing their survival depends on it. Ojibwe culture, language, and customs are interwoven throughout. Character development is a great strength in Erdrich's writing; she has a knack for creating humorous and endearing characters, and this story is no exception. Pencil drawings throughout, especially those of Makoons learning to ride a horse and hunt, help readers visualize the narrative.

"Arts, Music & Photography","Description: ""I'm a little white duck sitting in the water, a little white duck doing what he oughter."" Children have sung this silly song written by Walt Whippo and Bernard Zaritzky for half a century. Performers from Burl Ives to Danny Kaye to Raffi have recorded it over the years. And now, for the first time, the classic sing-along song about the duck that ""quack, quack, quacks,"" the frog that ""glug, glug, glugs,"" and the bug that ""bzz, buzz, bzz's"" has made its way into picture-book format. Joan Paley's gorgeous collages are full of vivacious color and three-dimensional pizzazz. Bold, brilliant greens and blues dominate, drawing the reader deeper and deeper into the happy little world of these water critters--happy, that is, until the little red snake comes along and scares off the duck and frog and eats the bug! But he's still glad to be ""a little red snake playing in the water,"" so all's well that ends well. To soften the blow of the untimely demise of the little black bug, all four of the characters (duck, frog, bug, snake), plus the guitar-strumming mouse narrator, take a bow on the last page, so sensitive young readers will know it's all just play-acting. Musical notation is included. (Ages 2 to 7) --Emilie CoulterWhether readers were first introduced to this classic 1950 kids' song by Danny Kaye, Burl Ives or Raffi, Paley's (What's That Sound, Woolly Bear?) full-bleed, double-spread collages will bring it vividly to life all over again (those who are making a first acquaintance will find the music included). Paley stages the song as a play. As a guitar-playing mouse narrates, a duck, a frog and a black bug are successively introduced as happily ""doing what [they] oughter... in the water."" Then along comes a little red snake who clears the room, so to speak, by scaring the duck and frog and eating the bug, leaving the song to conclude, ""Boo! Hoo! Hoo!"" But the book itself ends on an up beat, with the bug, along with the rest of the cast, taking a bow as the animal audience clamors, ""Bravo."" Working with cut paper, crayon, pastel and washes of watercolor, Paley creates spread after spread of bold, dramatically cropped tableaux; her strong, graphic lines and compositions are handsomely tempered by the rich, aquatic-inspired palette. Her frog is an especially appealing creation, gleefully stretching his spotted emerald body across the length of the page, and registering expressions that range from languor to alarm.

Literature & Fiction,"Description: ""The author of Franky (2016) now offers another tale for young tinkerers and gadget-lovers. Each item in the pile of discarded junk that Gus--portrayed as an increasingly grimy pig in mechanics' overalls--keeps out behind his service station comes in handy as one motorist after another wheels in needing a fix: Rico the rhino, for example, is too big for his Vespa ('Gus, this seat--I'm overflowing'). Gina the giraffe is too cold in her roofless Volkswagen, Walter the walrus and Miss P. the penguin are too hot, and Henry the hare's delivery truck needs a power boost. Whatever the problem, Gus has a patterned response ('Let's see. I have some bits and bobs. / This goes with that. There. Just the job!') and a clever solution. Come nightfall, Gus simultaneously washes and wheels himself home on a bicycle-shower that incorporates a last few 'bits and bobs.' Recycling with flair: just the job!""--Booklist""Gus the pig, the good-natured star of Leo Timmers's Gus's Garage (Gecko, $16.99; ages 3 to 8) also knows his cars and, as his ever-present smile attests, delights in inventing new ones. When a penguin overheats or a hare needs a turb charge they turn to Gus, who customizes their vehicles using the pile of 'bits and bobs' heaped alongside his shop. Each page spread presents the garage from the same vantage point, and this well-crafted stage set allows the reader to track the refuse pile's dwindling inventory. By the end of the book only a little tree stands where the pile once stood. The tree provides a home for an odd assortment of birds, proving once again that everything can be made useful. This is an amusing book to reread, since even the smallest details are assigned a narrative purpose. Clearly, one animal's clutter is another pig's livelihood in this buoyant, rhyming tale.""--The New York Times Book ReviewReturning to the vehicular focus of Bang and Who's Driving? Timmers introduces a string of animals who drive quirky cars and a good-natured pig mechanic who makes them even quirkier. Gus has a one-pump garage in the middle of nowhere and a stash of greasy, worn-out parts. ""Whatever will he use them for?"" Timmers wonders. A rhino in biker gear drives up on a too-small scooter:: ""Gus, this seat--I'm overflowing."" Gus always says the same thing: ""Let's see. I have some bits and bobs. / This goes with that. There. Just the job!"" A patched-up armchair, an extra rear wheel, and the rhino has a comfy new seat. To warm Gina, a giraffe, in her convertible, Gus combines a wood-burning stove with a stack of metal drums to make a towering heating system. A walrus gets hydration from a rooftop bathtub, and a penguin's roadster gains a pink refrigerator to keep her cool. Amid all the fun, the emphasis is on imaginative tweaking, reusing things, and cheerful help, selflessly given. Mechanically minded readers will want to do what Gus does; other will wish he lived next door.Leo Timmers is one of Belgium's preeminent picture book authors, with a large and loyal following.

Miss Rene then buys plastic dolls to live in the houses, though the dolls ""were dull and didn't do anything."" But when Miss Rene's barn blows down in a storm, its inhabitants, a cache of frisky mice, move indoors and before long the dollhouses acquire much livelier occupants. Peterson's (The Orphan Seal) sometimes staid pictures are at their most playful as they show the mice, now dressed in tiny doll outfits, pitching the plastic dolls out the window, cavorting in the ""secret drawer"" where Miss Rene keeps her chocolate, and partying all night; meanwhile, she and her lazy cat lie awake, unable to sleep with all the noise-making. At last, Miss Rene builds a small sailboat (named The Good Riddance) to carry the mice on a trip around the world, only to discover that she misses their ""squeaky singing and pittery-pattery dancing"" and that her houses look less beautiful with no one to use them. Kids will be as tickled as Miss Rene at the return of the diminutive crew, who, sporting costumes from all parts of the globe, unload their cargo of wood and fabrics from various continents enough to keep the miniaturist busy for quite some time. A jolly and jaunty escapade. Ages 4-8. Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.reS-Gr 2-Miss Rene is a rather eccentric soul who spends her solitary life in a big house by the sea crafting miniature houses and accoutrements. Dolls are added almost as an afterthought. Life in the stylish but dull dollhouses is forever changed after a fierce winter storm drives the barn mice indoors. They are naturally attracted to the perfectly proportioned little abodes and waste no time in chucking the plastic dolls out the windows and making themselves right at home. Miss Rene is horrified by the festive, mannerless little marauders and concocts a plan to send them on their way. She fashions a little boat aptly named The Good Riddance and gives each mouse a one-way ticket around the world. Life, Miss Rene discovers, is a good deal quieter and sadder without the cheerful rodents. Months later, when the mice unexpectedly return from their travels resembling a veritable United Nations delegation and bearing gifts, the reunion is a happy one. The coastal Maine setting throughout the seasons is nicely evoked by the watercolor illustrations. The mice are drawn with a good deal of personality and whimsy that is less apparent in the human face and figure of Miss Rene.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: PreSchool-Grade 2-When Katie's water phobia threatens to exclude her from the Porker twins' pool party, gentle swimming lessons with Patsy Polarbear save the kitten's social life. Meisel and Rockwell offer a practical tale populated by genial cartoon animals dressed in an amusing assortment of swimming attire. Although this book joins ranks with stories like Martha Weston's Tuck in the Pool (Clarion, 1995) and Jonathan London's Froggy Learns to Swim (Viking, 1995) for reassuring those who are hydrophobic, it has no surprises. However, the peripheral characters, such as a rabbit in oversized trunks and a boogying cow, have plenty of charm.Gay Lynn Van Vleck, Henrico County Library, Glen Allen, VACopyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.I don't remember learning to read; it seems as though I've always known how. In the same way, I don't know when I first began to draw and paint. I've always loved books and have always known I wanted to be an artist. So making picture books for children was my natural calling. I still remember how the world looked to me when I was very young, so communicating with children just starting off on what I hope will be a lifetime love of books feels right.Many of the books I write I illustrate myself, but I've also been lucky to have collaborated with other illustrators who bring their own special gifts and vision to the words I write.One of these is my daughter, Lizzy Rockwell. She has collaborated with me on a series of books about a group of children learning about the world, and telling the reader about themselves, in the sort of charmed and happy classroom all children should have. Two of the titles are just right for the fall back-to-school season Halloween Day and Thanksgiving Day.Paul Meisel has illustrated Morgan Plays Soccer, published in August 2001. This is the first of a series of books about what it means to be a ""good sport"". Sports are a big part of childhood. Even those who aren't good at them must learn the rules of the game. As Morgan Brownbear finds out, it isn't easy although if you have good friends who are also good sports it helps.I've never met a child who wasn't intrigued by insects. Steve Jenkins' illustrations for Bugs Are Insects, Let'S Read And Find Out (May 2001) show why children like my youngest grandson, Christian, are taken with the beauty and variety they see in the insect world.I believe that once a book is published it belongs to its readers. So now I'm busy working on ideas for new books. I love doing this, for I'm always refreshed by starting this kind of adventure carrying an idea all the way turning it into a book for others to read and enjoy.; Title: Katie Catz Makes a Splash (Good Sports)",2,1091,"[5454, 25356, 36248]"
Literature & Fiction,"Description: Grade 1-4?Biblical references to the mother of Jesus are actually quite scanty, and dePaola has woven some appropriate legends concerning her childhood, her betrothal to Joseph, and her dormition with a graceful, simple rendition of the pertinent scriptural passages (based upon The New English Bible) to round out the story. The writing style is restrained, elegant, and expressive. Handsome, framed, full-page paintings; harmonizing, rectangular spot illustrations on the pages of text; and a clear, attractive typeface give a balanced, dignified appearance to the book. The colors are subdued, yet rich, and the figures have a still, eternal quality particularly appropriate to the timelessness of the subject. Mary continues dePaola's tradition of outstanding presentations of stories of the Bible and saints without proselytizing or bias.?Patricia Pearl Dole, formerly at First Presbyterian School, Martinsville, VACopyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ages 5^-8. Based on the New English Bible and legends about the mother of Jesus, this picture book tells the story of Mary's life in words and full-color artwork. Although the text has a biblical tone, the words are simple and clear. A feeling of joyful reverence pervades the book. The illustrations, some full-page and others in smaller horizontal panels, offer young children a visual experience similar to that of stained glass windows, which spoke to medieval nonreaders: the art suggests the story through a series of beautiful tableaux. And as in stained glass windows, some of the objects shown have symbolic meanings that enrich the viewer who recognizes them, though knowledge of the symbolism is not necessary for enjoyment of the art. Defined by strong lines and enriched by subtle shades and overlays of color, the simple, yet majestic illustrations have an underlying rhythm of forms that unifies their composition. In the larger paintings, the main figure or figures are framed by arches, architectural arches as well as similar shapes formed by clothing and trees.

History,"Description: Kindergarten-Grade 3--A picture book about the sinking of the cargo ship Edmund Fitzgerald during a storm on Lake Superior in 1975. The vessel's bell, which eventually became a memorial to the lost sailors, is the focal point of the narrative. Tension builds steadily as the story unfolds. Members of the crew are introduced by name, and the fictionalized dialogue makes the story more immediate and true to life. Conversation, largely between Captain McSorley and the captain and first mate of the Arthur M. Anderson, another ship on the lake at the time, is undocumented. A poem interspersed throughout the text creates a sentimental, disjointed effect. Endpapers list names, positions, and hometowns of the men, and an afterword by the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society describes how the bell was retrieved and became a memorial. Paintings show the movement and danger of the lake, and different angles are used to capture the drama of the tragedy. This title should be considered an additional purchase where there is regional demand.--Debbie Stewart, Grand Rapids Public Library, MI Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Gr. 2-5. This handsome picture book draws on history to tell the story of the last voyage of the Edmund Fitzgerald, a ship that sank in a Lake Superior storm in 1975. All 29 crew members drowned. The text combines prose paragraphs with rhymed couplets, a device that works fairly well, as the book both tells the tale and laments those who drowned. Wargin uses the ship's bell as a unifying focus for the story. When the ship was at sea, the bronze bell clanged every four hours to signal the watch change, and later, ""The battered bell rang as the storm held its grip-- / It rang for the men at the heart of the ship."" Finally, it was retrieved from the sunken vessel and replaced with a replica inscribed with the names of those who perished. The dark, dramatic paintings expressively illustrate the somber story with respect for the men and for the danger of the treacherous storm, which is vividly portrayed.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: Following her mother's emergency knee surgery, 12-year-old Ronnie Sparks becomes her brother's keeper. The task is daunting because 7-year-old Gee suffers from severe ADHD. In an effort to speed up her recovery, Mom arranges for her father to take the kids on a road trip. Pop reluctantly agrees, and they all set out for Kansas, helping Pop search for wind-power-generating sites. Ronnie quickly becomes a buffer between Pop and Gee, stuck in the impossible position of trying to contain her brother's outrageous behaviors so that Pop won't throw a tantrum and drive everyone home. Amusing chapter-heading quotations, taken from a self-help book Ronnie has just read, lighten the mood of the story, even as Ronnie's outlook on her personal situation continues to deteriorate. The main characters are particularly well drawn and believable, and readers will root for both children as they attempt to overcome the obstacles placed in front of them.

Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: Grade 46This is Sonnenblick's third and final book about fifth-grader Willie and his imaginary friend, Dodger, a blue chimpanzee. In this installment, Willie's dad, a self-help writer, has come up with a brilliant idea for his new book: he'll have each family member follow the advice from one of his previous books and document the results. Willie's assignment is Kid on a Quest: Be Your Own Hero. His opportunity comes when he, his friend Lizzie, and the student council join forces to prevent the woods next door to their school from being destroyed by developers. Of course, the problem is less straightforward than it seems; these are magical woods, containing Dodger's Field of Dreams, and before the quest is over, Willie's sister is kidnapped by leprechauns. But with a little magic and the help of his friends, Willie becomes a hero in his own right. In addition to plenty of humor, this fantasy offers realistic relationships and an environmental message. Give it to old fans and be prepared to help newcomers locate the first two books in the series.Laurie Slagenwhite Walters, Baldwin Public Library, Birmingham, MI (c) Copyright 2010. Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc. No redistribution permitted.When Willie, his best friend, Lizzie, and his pal Dodger (a hyperactive blue chimpanzee with strange powers) learn that the nearby woods is about to be sold for development, they marshal their resources to save this literally magical place and its inhabitants. Meanwhile, Willies sister, Amy, is captured by leprechauns. The book is strongest when rooted most firmly in reality and weakest soaring into fantastic realms. Still, fans of the earlier two Dodger and Me books have never lacked the ability to suspend disbelief. They will find this volume, evidently the last in the series, amusing and satisfying.

Animals,"Description: Day (the Carl books) and Edens (the Santa Cows stories) team up for this quirky, not altogether successful tale about a bullterrier puppy. Darby chews and destroys so many things in the Bell family's home that he is banished to a fenced-in doghouse. But when heavy rains precipitate an embankment collapse and the Bells' oceanside house is buried in the landslide, it is Darby who tunnels his way to the trapped family and leads everyone to safety. As always, Day's art is wonderfully expressive, and just the eager look on Darby's face and the ready-for-action position of his tail prove that she understands bull terriers as well as she does rottweilers. The storytelling, however, feels contrived. Opposite the title page is an ""ad"" showing Darby and his littermates; the opening spread features the children pleading for one of the puppies; the next spread, introduced by the phrase ""A week or so later,"" pictures the Bells at a counter labeled ""Airfreight Pick-up,"" asking if there is a shipment for them. Then, as the story progresses, none-too-subtle clues in the picturesAroad signs, weather warnings on TV screensAforeshadow the trouble ahead. Subsequent abrupt shifts in narration begin to call attention to themselves, and as a result, the arc of the story feels uneven, as if the whole exercise is an elaborate set-up for Darby's heroic feat. Ages 3-8. (Sept.) Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.PreSchool-Grade 2-English bull terrier Darby is described in a mail-order catalog as ""lively and affectionate."" True, but his breeder did not mention, ""Chews everything!"" Still, when the new pet arrives, the Bell family members love his sense of fun, and train him to sit, speak, and fetch. Nothing is safe, however, from Darby's teeth. After he damages furniture, photographs, plants, and pillows, Mr. Bell puts the pup in an outdoor fenced enclosure. Throughout the story, disaster has been foreshadowed. During a storm, the family's beachfront home collapses, trapping them inside. Rescue workers try to get the Bells out, but it is Darby that literally chews through the debris and makes a tunnel for them to use to escape. The story ends with a final portrait of the proud dog wearing a ""Canine Hero Award"" medal and holding in his mouth a piece of the endpaper he has ""bitten"" off. The watercolor paintings depict his destructive behavior in a realistic but fond manner. Day is famous for her books about Carl the Rottweiler. In Darby she has created another canine that children will love.Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christopher's School, Richmond, VA Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.; Title: Darby, The Special Order Pup",1,36261,"[47481, 57306, 73356]"
Growing Up & Facts of Life,"Description: PreS-Gr 2While the title and cover art give the impression that what follows will be both a humorous and amorous tale, this aquatic adventure is neither. Even young readers will figure out the solution to Charlie Shark's dream of a kiss and Olivia Octopus's longing for a hug after the first page turn.
