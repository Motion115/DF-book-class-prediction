Growing Up & Facts of Life," D ear Amazon Readers : I never really know where my stories come from . I only know where I come from , and that ' s from a family of mor bid ly curious people . One of my a unts told me that my grandparents used to take their three daughters to the Grey h ound bus station on Friday nights . They ' d watch the passengers coming and going , and make up stories about them . Of course , this was in Pe oria , Illinois , in the pre - TV era , when entertainment was largely a do - it - your self proposition . I think the world can be divided into two camps of people : those who come and go and get on with the business of life , and the rest of us whose business it is to wonder what other people are doing and why and with whom . The 4 3 Old Cemetery Road series is full of faces and places the author has wondered about over the years . Sp ence M ansion , home to Ign at ius B . Gr ump ly , Se ym our Hope , and the ghost of Olive C . Sp ence , is based on an actual house in Pe oria that the author ' s sister ( and illustr ator ) Sarah and she rode by on their bikes hundreds of times as kids . They never knew who lived there , but they ' ve wondered about that place for decades . If the author were a ghost , she knows she ' d want to hang her hat ( or opera glasses ) in an old Victorian like that house . Who wouldn ' t want to write their Last Will and Testament in lim er icks as Noah Bre th does in Till Death Do Us Bark ? The author has always loved reading ob itu aries , especially those of eccentric old million aires . They ' re the ones who can afford to do the really lo ony things the rest of us only dream about doing . The author considers reading ob itu aries part of her job as a writer and as a person too . She thinks we have an obligation to be interested in one another ; to wonder , as her grandparents did , about other people ' s lives . For her , writing fiction is only a small step from watching people at a Grey h ound station . The only difference is that the bus station is her desk , and she has to create the passengers and follow them to their final destination , sp ying all the while , without getting kicked off the bus . In book three of the 4 3 Old Cemetery Road series , Se ym our takes on an abandoned Irish wolf h ound that bar ks around the clock , much to the dis may of his adopt ive parents . While searching for the dog ' s owner , Se ym our encounters the ghost of Noah Bre th , an eccentric million aire who converted his fortune to rare coins in an attempt to teach his unpleasant children a lesson .
